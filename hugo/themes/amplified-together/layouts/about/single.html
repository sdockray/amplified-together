            <p>The exhibition showcases the work of students completing undergraduate and postgraduate coursework programs at the School.  The show is a culmination of years of study in art, design, art history and art theory. It represents the successful resolution of thought processes, skills and making, working across disciplines, showcasing creativity, strength of ideas and reflecting the exceptional teaching and learning at the School.</p>
            <p>In 2021, the Graduating Exhibition will take place online. This platform offers the opportunity for graduating students to showcase their work to wider audiences, whilst providing insight into their individual practice and learning. The website exemplifies the vibrant and fulfilling work of this yearâ€™s graduating cohort; welcoming new visitors, inviting conversation and creating connections between the students, our community and global audiences.</p>
            <p>You can support our graduates by purchasing their artwork. Students may elect to have art available for purchase, please be aware that this is at their discretion.</p>
            <p>Please direct sales and general artwork enquiries directly to each student via their online platform.  We encourage you to contact the Gallery Team at soad.gallery@anu.edu.au, should you have any difficulties. </p>
            <p>Student views are their own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Australian National University School of Art & Design.</p>
