Things are a bit different this year.

**_Amplified / Together_** is an online platform showcasing graduating students from the Australian National University School of Art & Design, across Visual Arts, Design and the Centre for Art History & Art Theory.

An online exhibition has allowed increased accessibility and visibility, whilst securing the continuation of the Graduating Exhibition during an unpredictable year.  This platform presented students with a new opportunity to create an online presence, and represent themselves to a global audience as practicing artists, designers and curators.

Thank you to Gallery staff, Saskia Scott, Irina Agaronyan and Megan Hinton for coordinating students and submissions and for implementing the online platform. To Sean Dockray, Pia van Gelder and Mitchell Whitelaw, for developing the online platform.  The Student Committee for their dedication and creativity in realising the exhibition. In particular, Chin-Jie Melodie Liu, Samantha Corbett, Andrew Jaffray, Alexa Malizon, Harriet McKay and Domonkos Szab√≥.  And finally, thank you to the lecturers and tutors for their considered guidance, teaching and adaptability through this challenging year.

Artworks may be available for purchase at the discretion of the Student. Please direct enquiries directly to each Graduate via their online platform. If you have any difficulties please contact the Gallery Team at [sofagallery@anu.edu.au](mailto:sofagallery@anu.edu.au)
