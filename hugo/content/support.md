**__Emerging Artist Support Scheme__**

The Emerging Artist Support Scheme (EASS) was conceived in 1988 by then Director of the School of Art & Design, Professor David Williams. The Scheme provides members of the ACT and broader community an opportunity to support students at the end of undergraduate programs, as well as during graduate studies. 

EASS is ideal for the corporate sector, institutional and individual patrons with a tangible means of assisting emerging artists. By supporting graduates, patrons assist in the development of Australiaâ€™s next generation of contemporary artists, designers and creative thinkers. Awards range from materials and magazine subscriptions, through to studio residencies, exhibition opportunities, and acquisitions of artwork for public, private and corporate collections.
