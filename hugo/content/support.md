**__Emerging Artist Support Scheme__**

The Emerging Artists Support Scheme (EASS) is an institution at the ANU School of Art & Design. Conceived in 1988 by then Director of the School of Art & Design, Professor David Williams, EASS has provided thousands of opportunities throughout its 36-year history. Thanks to the strong support of the wonderful community of arts patrons, including individuals and families, businesses, galleries, organisations, and local government, EASS has continued to make an important contribution to the cultural life of the ACT and beyond.
 
Patrons of the scheme support our undergraduate and postgraduate students by offering a variety of awards, and commissioning and acquiring new artworks.  The Emerging Artists Support Scheme offers countless opportunities for our graduates, including strengthening the prominence of art and design in our local regions and helping our graduates find their place in the national creative industries sector as well as on the international stage. The breadth and scope of the Emerging Artists Support Scheme is unique to the ANU School of Art & Design. 

Support from Patrons provides crucial assistance to graduating artists and designers when it is most valuable - at the beginning of their independent careers.  If you would like to find out more about the program, please email [admin.somad@anu.edu.au](mailto:admin.somad@anu.edu.au)
