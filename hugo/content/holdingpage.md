2021 has been an undoubtedly challenging and chaotic year. As lockdowns were put in place forcing many to work from home, the students of the ANU School of Art & Design learnt to adapt to online tutorials while remaining creative during a time of great uncertainty. To not cause any further disruption to the students, the decision was made to host the 2020 ANU Graduating Exhibition online.  Featuring over 60 students across twelve disciplines, _Amplified/ Together_ is a testament to the adversity the graduating cohort have navigated through.
