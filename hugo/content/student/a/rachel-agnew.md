please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Having recently graduated from the Australian National University with a Bachelor of Visual Arts, Rachel Agnew tests the boundaries of abstract, conceptual and documentary photography within present-day constructs. Her practice engages with both digital and analogue processes as she investigates the role of the photographer as contemporary artistic and commercial definitions continue to coexist and transform. Her practice is largely influenced by personal experience as she presents work that often implies unspoken context, choosing to provide her audience with a framework for their own external thought.

The most recent of her projects, 'Inside Out' and 'At Home', take a closer look at how recent circumstances have changed the way we receive and interpret information, whether it is coming from an external source or from within the domestic spaces that we have been confined to for such extended periods of time."
