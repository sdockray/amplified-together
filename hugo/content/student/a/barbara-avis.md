biography: "My major work is about making visual interpretations of mathematical sequences used in the construction of patterns. These strict systems are available for dissection and manipulation, which in turn make new patterns. 
  
 I have created stools and tables to express a few of these patterns. The surface is made using parquetry, a traditional technique of woodworking using timber veneers. It is slow and repetitive work with a direct tactile interaction with the material. The work here is quite small although it can be scaled to any size.
 
 The key element of the work is that it is both practical and decorative; to hold a cup, to be sat on. This intention relates to issues important to me : the use of natural materials to promote wellbeing; and the reduction of waste in a world of endless production."
