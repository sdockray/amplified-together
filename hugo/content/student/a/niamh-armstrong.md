Here  
A pinky promise 
To those who made me   
 
'Here' is a painted diary. When assembled and restaged, imagery from my camera roll builds to form a personal document; dynamically articulating vingettes of memory, histories and inner territories. Despite feeling both energized and secure in this subject matter, my progress was halted by the weight of expectations I held for myself. I was debilitated by the pressure of the blank canvas. I turned to the marked and textured surface of my dadâ€™s old drop sheets, reclaiming the canvas again as a functional tool; weaving my imagery into the collection of past family projects. Through the progressive layering of painterly gesture, the drop sheet performs as an ever-evolving document; paint and history come together to build an intimate representation of self."
