biography: "My artwork this year has focused on transhumanism and the relationship between technology and humans. Transhumanism is the belief that, through integrating with technology, humanity can radically improve the quality and length of life. However, a range of ethical, social, and political issues arise from this goal. My work seeks to challenge viewers preconceptions regarding their relationship with technology and establish a dialogue around these issues. Using an Xbox 360 Kinect, motion capture software, Unreal Engine and a projector, my latest creation, Life in Silicon, has the user inhabit a digital avatar and explore a virtual environment projected onto a wall. This experience attempts to forge a visceral connection between the viewer and the technology, prompting them to question the barrier between the two. Transhumanists believe that we will be able to control our own evolution; if this is true, our discussions and decisions now may impact humanity for the rest of time."
