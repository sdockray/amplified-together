biography: "Balik Kampung, Going Home… explores my cultural identity and heritage as a mixed-race woman by reconfiguring and re-contextualising photos from family archives. Embedding and layering these images within textiles, that evoke the clothing made and worn by my ancestors around the world, I navigate a complex set of histories and challenge the documentary purpose of photography. Ethnically, I am of Sinhalese, Malayali, English, Shetlander, German and Irish decent. As an Australian Malaysian, the journey of uncovering this hybridity has been a deeply personal investigation of images, objects, and materials. Fabric – embroidered saris, handmade lace, and tartan – has interwoven the sensory and visual of the embodied here and now with fragments of family history. Rather than defining a fixed past or finding something that has been lost, a new set of connections to identity has been made and a future narrative discovered."
