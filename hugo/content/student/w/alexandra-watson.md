biography: "This work opens up a different kind of imaginative thinking about the Anthropocene, drawing from ideas around the global mobility of humans and animals. It invites you to bear witness to a fictional, but entirely possible, historical apocalyptic turning point: imagining a Gypsy Moth invasion which would pose a great threat to Australian agriculture. The life cycle and spread of this highly invasive species is captured in Future Fossil 1-3 and brought to life through augmented reality. International Package: the disturbing release heightens the sense of threat at a personal level, by unleashing ravenous Gypsy Moth caterpillar in domestic space.  

With references to the horror bug movies of the 50’s and Hieronymus Bosch’s representations of the apocalypse. The imagined monster becomes a symbol for facing bigger fears: the horror of what we have done in the pursuit of science, technology and ever-increasing global mobility."
