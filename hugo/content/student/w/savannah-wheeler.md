biography: "Savannah Wheeler is a multidisciplinary artist, who primarily works in the mode of installation. Central to her practice is exploring the possibilities of environmentally conscious materials, through speculative world-building. Her bioplastic constructions are the starting point of an investigation into the different permutations and applications of biodegradable materials. With a distinct focus on the qualities of bioplastics, her work lends itself to the possibilities of future studies into the functionality of the material."
