biography: "In memory of Queer lives lost to hate-crimes and suicide.

April Widdup’s interactive sculptures acknowledge the queer experience of navigating places and spaces which have been designed to isolate such bodies. Spatial coding operates to regulate and direct interactions and behaviour, often causing bodies that exist outside the ‘norm’ to feel vulnerability, discomfort, and the social pressure to conform. Through form and display, Widdup calls attention to this, while bringing into scrutiny the methods through which minority bodies have historically been grieved and remembered as victims. Without remembering the lives, and lived experiences of those we have lost, we have no history, and no way to challenge the political and social issues facing queer bodies today. You lived, and I will remember that seeks to spark new traditions for remembering, mourning, and most importantly healing."
