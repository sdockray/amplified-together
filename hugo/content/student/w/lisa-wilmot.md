biography: "Specific moments spent in my home, garden and surrounding bushland, mostly during lockdown, serve as the inspiration for my paintings. Sometimes I suggest the built and natural environments but I do not wish to directly represent them. I invest in my paintings, especially through the time I take to paint them. I am interested in hard edged geometric abstraction and the materiality of the painting process, particularly the ultimate surface quality of the painting. Bold and contrasting colours attract attention and, in most of my paintings, a stripe motif, repeated at irregular intervals and in uneven configurations, holds and directs that attention. Saturated and desaturated colours combine with different, and sometimes illusionary, shapes to disrupt the viewers sense of perspective. Shapes form and appear to tilt forward and backward, suggesting both atmospheric and linear perspective at play."
