biography: "My work re-imagines the hyper-civilised nature of human beings. The human takes lessons from the wild and untamed, and rightly gives the power back to other species. Itâ€™s a fiction, with a cynical comment on reality.

These works are suspended in a fantasy world, full of ambiguity, hallucination and idealism. They reflect a balance between refinement and savagery, life and death, delight and unease."
