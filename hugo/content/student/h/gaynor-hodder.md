please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Our relationship to landscape is more than the view we see before us.  Inspired by  walking in the Mountain Ash forests found in Eastern Victoria and flying in Papua New Guinea and the memories of those experiences, Gaynor Hodder seeks to convey the wonder and mystery of being enfolded in the landscape and how textiles might be manipulated and combined with hand- and embroidery stitches to suggest the topography of landscape. Through her practice-led research, she employs the processes and techniques of making natural dyes to colour the fabric and threads which provide a colour palette from the local environment.  Her definition of landscape is multi-layered - the invisible and the visible, the emotional and the physical experience, macroscopic and microscopic, and the spiritual and the aesthetic."
