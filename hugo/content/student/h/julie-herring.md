biography: "In this body of work, I have intuitively visualised my brainâ€™s inner monologues. The never-ceasing chatter captured through intuitive mark making in thread, pen, pencil and ink; whilst mono-printing reflects the unexpected behavior of my brain. These source images are then manipulated and layered in Photoshop, before being printed on transparent film and mounted on vinyl. The images become objects that can be further reconfigured, allowing me to revisit the relentless internal talk from a new vantage point.  The final work allows me to speak out about what cannot be silenced by keeping silent and seeks to provoke contemplation of one's own mental health."
