biography: "Murmurs is a series of artworks that explore the process of oral storytelling and the alteration of memory over time. The work acts as a recording of the changes a story went through as it passed between a group of people. Each panel represents the culmination of each iteration of the story's progression and is painted with ink onto linen voile. The way the ink and fabric interact with one another to distort the image echoes the way people's memories and the story itself decayed over time. I also wanted to use the two mediums for their close association with storytelling, as fabric and textile language has often been used to describe the process of making a story, while ink has frequently been used to record them in pictures or words. Murmurs wouldn't have been possible without the assistance of Ren Fanale, Emily James, Alice Kelly, Jordan McDonald and Malika Sinha."
