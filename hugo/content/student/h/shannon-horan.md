biography: "Shannon Horan is an Australian Sculptor based in Canberra. She believes it is important to share stories, which is why they are central to her artwork. Shannon aims to explore 'human needs' in relation to our imaginative world and the physical living space we create within our homes. It feels like our experience of nature will be increasingly mediated through technology, as the scale and abundance of nature is lost, we will recreate it in other ways. Inspired by her garden and other aspects of nature, she utilises natural materials and found objects where she can and aspires to minimise her environmental footprint, she feels she has a responsibility to promote a sustainable and environmentally friendly creative practice."
