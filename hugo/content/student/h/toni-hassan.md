biography: "My Honours work culminated in a collaborative and cathartic site-specific piece called 'Black Summer Lamentation on City Hill'. Originally planned for Canberraâ€™s City Hill, it became an online event with musicians and readers who had experienced the 2019-20 fires. Using my body as a visual medium, the piece created space for shared climate grief and affirmed the value of relationships with the self, planet and others. The performance emerged from recorded conversations with women in the capital region about the impacts of Black Summer on their body and breath, and their sense of the future. Audio extracts from the conversations were used to create short videos. The transcripts became a book illustrated by paintings and photographs reflecting on that myth-busting summer."
