biography: "Holding Space comprises a series of sculptural textiles banners materialising the language of menstrual shame. Menstrual shame exists in a culture of concealment expecting us to be least visible at our most vulnerable. This work gives physical form to silenced words making us feel seen and heard. 
 
 Historically rooted in activism, Holding Space utilises the language of our foremothers in the protest banners of marches past, combining the political mobilisation and community building of quilt making with the soft sculptural possibilities of text as object. Thoughts and emotions have been made visible, validated through the care of embodied labour. While the words invoke shame, the scale and inherent softness of the banners offer comfort, as if they could hold the body with domestic familiarity.
 
 Whilst holding space for connection and conversation, these banners seek to dismantle the language of menstrual shame and call for action: asserting a space for change."
