biography: "The connection between body and my creative practice is a constant inspiration. My graduating work Held, draws on a sense of personal identity, self-acceptance and appreciation. Exploring the idea of body and driving connections that are relatable and comforting.
  
 This series centres around organic bowl-like forms that speak to the body as a vessel. The forms are wheel thrown and altered by hand to represent the folds and creases of skin.
 Some of the forms have no base, to emphasise our bodies as cavities. The intimate and nestled composition highlights the vulnerability and softness of the body and clay itself. 
 
 Held recognises and celebrates interconnection of body parts and our perceptions of body functional, imperfect, beautiful."
