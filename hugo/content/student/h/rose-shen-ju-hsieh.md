biography: "In the history of ceramics, humans make ceramics form like themselves; For example, the handle of the teapot relationship to the hand, the lid resemble a head. My work is centred on making anthropomorphic vessels and grouping them into a social microcosm, the vessel represents humans, while numbers of vessels form a society. Furthermore, I spent two years exploring hand squeezing techniques in ceramics and transforming these abstractive clay lines into a corresponding environment for vessels.
 
 The COVID pandemic has been happening for nearly two years, this forces us to do the change in our life. For example, keeping the social distance, staying at home, following the travel restrictions. However, the change of social formation also leads to the influence of emotion and mental health. Therefore, I portrayed everyday objects as human beings in society, presenting the different social formations of the COVID crisis that happen from the beginning and after. Similarly, I concentrate on diverse forms making on the vessels, expressing intense emotion that was experienced by people during the pandemic."
