biography: "Maddie Hepner is an American-Australian artist working within photography and media arts, based in Canberra, Australia. Her artistic practice covers topics of personal identity, political discourse, and the utilisation of the found image within a digital context. Hepner is interested in how circulated images and memes work within the alt-right Internet sphere. Her Honours project in 2021 delves into the darker corners of the Internet to understand how this division of photography aligns closely with the division of the concept of the American Dream in the United States today. She has exhibited at a multitude of galleries across Canberra, including Gorman Arts Centre, PhotoAccess, and The Front, and has had photographs commissioned and published in the Woroni Newspaper, Sydney Morning Herald, and Canberra Times."
