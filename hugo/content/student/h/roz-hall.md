biography: "Roz Hall is an emerging ceramic artist whose current work focuses on questioning and shifting perceptions of the everyday. 
 
 In an investigation of the application of ceramics, I introduce kinetics to my pieces through the variation of vessel forms in combination with appliances. I aim to manipulate responses to an object's behaviour or function by drawing on collective familiarity with ceramics, hinging on the senses of surprise and wonder. I manufacture these moments with precision, whimsy, and a modernist eye to catch the viewer off-guard, pause time, and present the Kinetics of Uncertainty. 
 
 The cohesion of handmade ceramics, movement, and gadgetry in my work feels strange, but the simple motive of each machine and its dynamic absurdity inspires a length of feelgood fascination. It is an exploration of the ceramic medium; through this, I hope viewers find an enjoyable sense of renewal in their perception of ceramics and its kinetic potential."
