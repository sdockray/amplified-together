biography: "Home Is Where The Hurt Is is a short film about the struggles of living by yourself in lockdown and the self imposed high standards that one puts on themselves. This work was created in the midst of the second covid lockdown in Canberra resulting in a poignant statement from myself into video format. Home Is Where The Hurt is is the exploration of existentialistic nihilism within a neo-liberal subjectivity. With the sudden change of both physical and creative freedom suddenly being restricted, the unease of living in the same box can cause one to envelop in intrusive self worth. The piece was created through the process of recording vignettes at different points of time where I would feel lost and consumed by academic, well being and social responsibilities. Home Is Where The Hurt is is a recollection of a memory that will soon be lost as the world and myself adjusts to the circumstances that are given to us."
