please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Hariz Ibrahim is a freelance artist, director and animator that primarily focuses on 2D animation. Much of his body of work explores common tropes, imagery, narrative conventions and styles found in pop culture media and approaches them in an absurdist and comedic manner. His most recent short film, 'Bedtime Stories NOT For Kids - That Time My Arm Got Possessed,' takes the form of a bedtime story about a boy who has his arm possessed with a sentient arm who acts independently. The intention was to create a story that balances the narrative conventions of the sincerity of a heroâ€™s journey and the pursuit of self-improvement and the irony in slasher-horrors and romance in film."
