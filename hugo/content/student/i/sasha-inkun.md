please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "2020 has been a year full of twists and turns. As the pandemic changes so many aspects of our lives, we havenâ€™t been able to come together and celebrate this year. In response to this I have invited the audience to celebrate all these lost moments with me, together/apart. The aim of my work is to bring together stories of celebration. To collect them, to share them and to wear them. 

My practice is based in metalsmithing, collaborative works and art that invites interaction. This is difficult in the current pandemic context. We cannot come together, and we cannot touch and experience things firsthand. But we can share in stories and objects, like we have for millennia."
