please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "How can one use the medium of photography and visual language to encourage an audience to see how surveillance is impacting their lives in overt and covert ways?

'Visualising Surveillance' seeks to develop a visual language for explaining the largely unseen and invisible networks of power that define contemporary Surveillance Capitalism.  

Through a series of studio investigations, the limits of Photography and visualisation are explored.  The resulting body of work critically engages with the physical manifestations of the architectural, technological and digital infrastructures that underpin contemporary surveillance; the effect these structures have on identity and community; and the fragile, prison-like nature of the surveillance apparatus that has come to dominate contemporary surveillance.  It utilises abstraction as the primary method to engage audiences to further understand the impact of surveillance on contemporary society."
