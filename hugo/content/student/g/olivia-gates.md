biography: "Olivia Gates (born 1997, NSW) is an artist working and living between Ngunawal and Ngambri Country (Canberra) and her home in Kiama on Dharawal Country. Working primarily with the material of glass, Oliviaâ€™s art practice explores strategies that foster her personal sense of belonging in the Australian post-mabo landscape as a descendant of white settlers and convicts. Her research relies on generational memory and connection to place as well as uncovering shared histories and confronting the ongoing impacts her lineage has on Country. Olivia is studying a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Honours) / Bachelor of Design at ANU. She has exhibited both locally and internationally and has acquired prizes recognising her work such as the Boronia Prize for excellence in glass, the Corning Museum of Glass / Australian National University School of Art and Design Partner Scholarship, and the Nigel Thomson Travel Grant."
