biography: "Scrap Sci-Fi is a sculptural and audio-visual experience exploring our unhealthy relationship with technology and of the creative process of art.
 
 From my experience with working with second-hand electronics; functioning or not and with working in a second-hand electronics store. I've observed how quick people are to throw away their old tech in place of the new and improved model. This has led itself to show peoples disregard towards how their products have been made or how they're discarded. This disregard carried onto the relationship between art and its process.
 
 Scrap Sci-Fi is about questioning these disregarded thoughts, re-using old technology, and confronting you with the creation of itself."
