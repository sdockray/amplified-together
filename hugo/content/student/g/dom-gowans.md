biography: "Dominic Gowansâ€™ art practice centres on the potential for art to challenge failures and harms in the current social order arising from the conflicting priorities of economic progress and community well-being and cohesion.  His work uses satire and humour to present incongruous representations of concepts or attitudes, using these disconnections to provoke discussion and consideration of alternative approaches to the norm.
The current project is a subversive response to our value systems, intended to question the ways in which our attitudes are formed, the premises we accept.  It uses the iconography and messaging of the dominant paradigm, with its associations upended to challenge this outcome.  He suggests a range of potential meanings in his work from which a viewer is encouraged to find theirs."
