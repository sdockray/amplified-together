biography: "My art is a response to the world around me, a way to reconcile my thoughts on issues I feel I have no power to change. It is a reaction to the things I cannot control, a way of demanding a voice. My work is equal parts statement, enjoyment, and therapy. When faced with difficult situations I prefer to take an ironic or comedic approach, to highlight the absurdity of the situation, to laugh rather than cry.
 
 My current project is a response to our value system, a subversive response to the waste in our society. Designed to question the valve of our discarded objects by altering several essentially worthless items to create different variations.
 
 Simple changes, potentially comic, will lead my audience to question the perceived differences in value, as well as questioning why these superficial details create differences in their appeal. Ultimately questioning why we view them differently although they are fundamentally the same."
