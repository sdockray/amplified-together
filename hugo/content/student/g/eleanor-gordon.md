It explores the development and recession of fine motor skills through time, and how objects and appearances change through time. The work uses Photoshop for the 2D animation, and the clips are edited using Premiere Pro. Eleanor uses rotoscoping for referencing of fingers and hand movements. The work was made over a period of months."
