biography: "I am Madison Graeber-Browne, born in 2000 on Ngunnawal, Ngambri country, and I work with different painting and drawing mediums. With these mediums I create artworks exploring how certain emotions bring specific colours to my mind and other people's minds. Painting different places, objects and various subjects of the everyday, I experiment with changing the colours in front of me to convey different feelings. I am interested in Art Therapy and how the act of making art can be an emotional/stress relief for someone. The artwork I have made for my final graduating project depicts the holiday houses at Norfolk Gardens in Batemans Bay. My family and I have been going on Summer trips there for nearly 20 years and these holiday memories fill me with serenity. I have painted Norfolk Gardens four times exploring different colour-blindness. They are deuteranomaly, protanopia, and tritanopia, compared to a normal vision sight painting."
