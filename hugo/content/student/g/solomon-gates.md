biography: "Dysregulation is a reflective work on the current state of invasive flora in Australia and the insufficient stewardship towards environmental conservation. Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) is the focus of the work as it is a ubiquitous noxious weed in Australia, restricting and disrupting natural processes within native flora and fauna. This idea was translated by drawing parallels between human physiology, native plants, and the unnatural 'silver' blackberry; limiting and impeding vital life functions such as gathering and consuming nutrients. Casting directly from blackberry cuttings enabled each piece to convey the malignant nature of blackberry growth though creating an uncanny visual representation of the common, yet foreign entity. Each work was constructed by soldering various lengths of stem together, then bending and forming them around the human physique as if they had grown naturally. Both the piercing nature and constricting form create a sense of claustrophobia."
