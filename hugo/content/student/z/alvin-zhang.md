biography: "Yongqi Zhang is a contemporary artist based in the Canberra region, His artistic practice is based on 3D computer graphics with experimental techniques and focuses on the ideas behind human experiences, such as life and death, religion, future, and consciousness. Yongqi has a Master(advanced) in Contemporary Practices in Art and Design (2021) and a Master of Visual Arts from ANU School of Art & Design.
 
 This project aims to engage the artist's religious imagination in the Anthropocene, based on the wrathful deity of Tantric Buddhism, creating a religious icon that adapts to the new age through contemporary computer graphics in response to the growing environmental crisis of the Anthropocene, which seeks to balance technological human prosperity with the prosperity of the natural environment in a more vivid and stimulating way than the gentleness of traditional Buddhism."
