biography: "My work is inspired by nature, culture, and feminist writing. I take interest in the process of painting, and love finding new ways to transform the act of painting in the digital age. The relationship between line and form within my paintings is akin to that of a drawing, yet painterliness remains in colour gradation within the lines and coloured ground. These paintings are based on a series of collages that are digitally traced and manipulated, with the final image is then transferred onto canvas. 
 
 The short story The Yellow Wallpaper, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, served as an inspiration for my Morphing Woman series. It is regarded as a prominent work in American feminist literature for its commentary of the attitudes toward the mental and physical health of women in the 19th century, ideas far ahead of their time. My work explores these issues by depicting body horror through a feminist lens disguised in soft and intentionally beautiful colours, disarming the viewer before their confrontation with unsettling imagery."
