biography: "Materialising the Impact of Digital Technology through Wearable Sculpture 
 
 Have you ever stopped to wonder what goes on inside our digital devices? Or the likeness of digital landscapes to our own mindscape as we aimlessly scroll through touch screens? These two landscapes, the digital and our minds, are not so dissimilar. 
 
 This series by Cathy Zhang materialises the impact of self-reflection in our hyperconnected, digital world. Utilising digital tools and resources and gold and silversmithing techniques, Zhang has uses components found in digital devices to create works that highlight the pervasive nature of digital technology and our anxious attachment to our devices. 
 
 This attachment is coupled with contemporary notions of wellness that demand a detox from our digital lives as we confront the relentless hold of digital technology over our lives and minds. Digital components are countered with acupuncture needles which speak to this precarious balance between connection and disconnection, pain and relief."
