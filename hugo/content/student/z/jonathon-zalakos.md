biography: "IT’S UNDER YOUR SKIN is my Design Honours thesis, through which I explore the co-determinative relationship between our designing and our (thoroughly designed) environment. 

The jewellery employs horror tropes, suggesting a weird subjectivity that has long influenced human culture, psychology and being. This characterisation of jewellery is at odds with normative design objects which sell the idea of our individual human subjectivities having control over objects, our behaviour, and our environment. Around the jewellery are diegetic pin-boards and video, contributing to an immersive installation. 

Through the research project, I explore connections between the theory of ontological design and design methodology. ‘Pulling worlds from things’ and ‘pulling things from worlds’ are proposed as methods for first understanding and then designing the ontological affordances of our environment. This invites analysis of both familiar and emerging designs in how they contribute to the way we understand and act in the world."
