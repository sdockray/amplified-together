please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "‘External Affect’ is a series that examines how divergent models of the self create confusion and discomfort when supported in the mind at the same time. These models are suggested by philosophers, psychologists, economists and so on. Where these models intercept, overlap and separate from each other, so do the distinct elements that compose the jewellery. Through this effort, thoughts are transported from the mind and onto the body."
