biography: "Inspired by the land and seascapes of coastal areas in southern New South Wales, my ceramic vessels explore the relationships humans share with place through abstracted depiction of landscape. 
 
 Viewing landscape is a highly psychological process with the capacity to shape people's relationship to place through forming conceptions such as beauty, value or safety. This is what drives my practice. By abstractly depicting the light and colour qualities of New South Wales coastal areas, my work distils the essence of a place characterised by dense vegetation, rock formations and expansive ocean horizons. At the same time, it relies on viewers psychological processes which form conceptions of the natural world to generate its meaning. 
 
 My pieces are wheel-thrown before being altered to create an undulating surface profile and accentuate the qualities of the thrown mark. Such qualities recall the structure of rock formations along the coastline. The segmentation of each vessel focusses the three-dimensional representation of landscape around a horizon line, and satin glaze finishes complement this. Operating in bands, my glazes explore colour field relationships as they relate to atmospheric qualities of light and colour. Soft hues of blue, white, orange and green mirror those found in the vegetation, sea and sky along the coastal landscape, and in the transitional areas where glazes overlap, each vessel registers a unique surface interaction of running, mixing and speckling."
