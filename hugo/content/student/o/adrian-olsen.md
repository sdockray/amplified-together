please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "In a year laden with challenges I have found great solace in the commonplace scenes of Edward Hopper. There is a camaraderie there. Not only did the artist produce scenes which could be recognizable to a New Yorker or a Cape Cod resident in their everyday experience, by investing such energy into the act of looking and ruminating on a particular sensation, Hopper also gave permission to his audience to dwell on a seemingly irrational or inconclusive thought. This is the driving force of my series; in my meditations on those fleeting moments which have managed to arrest my attention, I wish to present an open invitation for others to do the same. I urge my viewers to look more closely at those aspects of life which our working routines have trained us to ignore. In these works, architecture does not act as the subject but as an expression of this practice."
