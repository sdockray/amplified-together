biography: "I am interested in four-dimensional space and how structures change as time (t) changes. 4D space can be viewed as it's intersections with 3D space. If you imagine a piece of paper and a cube passes through it, if you have the view of the piece of paper you can't perceive the structure of the cube in 3D space, only its intersection with the 2D paper. I have used spatial practice and projection to explore my perception of the limitations of time and space during COVID-19 lockdown periods. I use multiple light sources as a way at gaining multiple perspectives of the space. The projections are confined within my bedroom, investigating the limitations of the space I occupied during social isolation"
