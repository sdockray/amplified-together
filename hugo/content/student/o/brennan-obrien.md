biography: "Based on Ngunnawal and Ngambri land, my work is predominantly oil paint on canvas. My paintings collage lived experience and subconscious, and the relationships shared between the living and the inanimate. Colour hidden within painted glazes speak to the periphery of dreams, the nature of time, and the imagination isolated. My paintings aim to recontextualise traditional techniques to a place of modern influence."
