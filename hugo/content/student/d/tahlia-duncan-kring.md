biography: "Beneath the skin of every person is a dense web of thoughts, feelings and beliefs, but such complexities are quickly forgotten in favour of surface appearances. My work explores how the individual elements in our mind impact our self-perception and develop our inner selves, as well as the tension which exists between the physical world and our mental one.These ceramic forms represent intersecting aspects of the internal self, normally invisible, and imagined within a metaphorical mental landscape - like bugs populating our ever-changing psychic ecosystem. 
 
 Despite their appearances, the bugs are not alien: they were created to reflect real life insects - insects intrinsic to the environment but often hated and demonized as creepy crawlies.
 The key is not the extermination of 'bad' thoughts, but management: if even the most toxic elements are properly managed - our mental gardens properly tended - we can flourish as human beings."
