please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "My work draws on traditions of portraiture and embroidery to explore themes of nostalgia, memory, personal lived experience and tradition. I’ve chosen a period of time all humans have in common, childhood. My project is not relevant to this current climate or any historical topics of conflict. It is calm, simple and pleasing, a tool for escapism, something I deem important for self-survival in this present time. I believe children are the less negative and sadistic form of a human, therefore a fitting vessel for this aim. I’ve utilized photographs of me as a child and artwork from my earlier years to help navigate my work. My choices of medium are dictated by reflecting on my personal relationship with art and making as a child. Colour choices were a calculated process, guided by research into the psychology of colour in children."
