biography: "Warping Myself is a physical manifestation of my 'mental skin'. It has been a journey of transcribing my emotions and experiences into fibre. I have knitted, sewn, fumbled and finessed my way through the process of making this piece. Working intuitively and in tacit interaction with my preferred materials, I have explored a language of expression that translates my subconscious. 
 
 The work is an assemblage of crafted and found elements. The mental skin is made of undyed wool which has been knitted through painstaking hours. Red cotton tangles and constricts, marring and deforming its host. The structure supporting and further distorting the knitting is fashioned from a salvaged doctor's examination table. Lashed to this are hazelnut sticks coppiced from my childhood home. 
 
 All these elements combine to explore my current state and express a yearning for change. I have unravelled myself in pursuit of understanding."
