biography: "Love Bites is a comedic multimedia installation consisting of sculpture and photo-media. The project is a surreal self-portrait of the artist in the form of a meta queer dating profile. The work looks at relational identity within both the digital and natural world. The project asks what role does technology play in our lives when it comes to intimacy and dating, as well as that of danger and desire? 
 
 At the centre of the work is a just over 5 metres long mechanical Great White Shark, hand crafted by the artist. The project follows the artist as she is slowly transformed and consumed by the Great White Shark. The work explores the different ways in which we experience life through physical and digital spaces by trying to create a sense of danger as well as intimacy with the viewer."
