biography: "Australian Contemporary Photographer, April Davis explores the concepts of life, death, regeneration, growth, and the Anthropocene. Through documenting the 2020 bushfire that ravished, the Pialligo Redwood Forest. Davis explores the regeneration of Pialligo Redwood Forest in the series Anthropogenic.

Anthropogenic explores the history of the Pialligo Estate. In which the artist has used photography and videography to show the effects the bushfire has on the environment and the effects the manmade forest has on the ecosystem.

Davis chose to digitally manipulate the landscape to show the effects humans have on the environment. The artist has chose mirroring to explore life and death of the forest, and to create an illusion using multiples of the same image. Davis wants the audience to explore her work to see the forest in real life, and the effects it has on the environment."
