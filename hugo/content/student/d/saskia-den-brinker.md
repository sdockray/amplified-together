biography: "\"Her Skin\" is constructed using fine silver chainmail interwoven with silver flowers. Attached around the neck using an ivory ribbon, it sits tightly, heavy and cold upon placement on the body, growing warmer with time. I have always been fascinated by the reproductive abilities of flowers and in this way see them as a powerful force and symbol in my work. The silver flowers have been interwoven into the chainmail to create a heavy, shielding layer. The repetitive and time-consuming processes of forming this piece could be considered excessive. However, is reflective of my personality as well as the value I have placed on both the process of creating, and the outcome of the collar. This work is a deeply personal reflection of myself over the last year and is represented through these processes that have become a coping mechanism during the pandemic and consequent self-discovery."
