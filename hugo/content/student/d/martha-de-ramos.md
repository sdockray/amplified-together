biography: "I have been exploring an imaginary vision of anthropogenic terrains through material forms. The Anthropocene is a proposed definition of humanity's major impact on the earth. Every significant mark and change we do will reflect in the future when it is found or revealed. 
 
 A terrain is more than just a landscape. There are many different terrains under the Anthropocene narrative, however mines have a special connection to ceramic. Most materials in ceramic must be mined to be collected, whether this is clay from a backyard or a glaze material from a large mining site across the world. The work is a series of collections; artifacts, processes, and close-up photography highlighting the small details. Each collection has several objects that hold resemblance to different materials and elements, objects like bowls that have been cut to reveal the thick glaze inside. Some chosen titles hint at their connection or elemental likeness."
