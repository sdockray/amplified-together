biography: "I have made a series of paintings that depict a fragmented human body in a collaged manner in order to isolate the tensions and unease that I feel towards my body. My paintings are made from a series of photographs I took of my own body, that are cut up and twisted around in my compositions to reflect the mixed and chaotic emotions I have had towards my own body. The body remains both recognisable and unrecognisable, where different angles and perspectives are displayed all at once. We are forced to confront ourselves through the reflections of mundane surfaces including the bathroom sink or a window pane. I have explored these themes through a series of oil paintings and digital sketches."
