please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "The New Room,' (2020) was created while I was working and studying from home, isolated from the rest of the world, in a bedroom that reflects the one displayed in this project. Unlike the real-life room, however, that is physical and connects to the rest of a house, The New Room is a step into the fictional, an out of time, an alternate dimension mish-mash of the familiar and the unfamiliar.
Inspired by cyberpunk and sci-fi genres, the work is an explorable 3D environment created using Autodesk Maya, Substance Painter, and Unreal Engine. You, the viewer, have the opportunity to explore this space in several different ways: through the static images, the 360 captures, or the interactive game versions."
