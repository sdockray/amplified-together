biography: "A three-part recollection of recent key life events, Conveying Steps a retelling of my story through footprints. Spurred on by losses - tragically sudden and painfully slow - as well as adventure, self re-discovery and discovery of another country's culture in the midst of the Omnicron wave, the piece is a window to the rollercoaster of my last 18 months, exploring how the human rises from loss and is changed as a result. As Edan Corkill wrote in his article about the grieving Japanese artists in the wake of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, \"And when the shaking finally stopped, they emerged as though transformed.\"

The piece, through the footprints, the floor plans, the ruminations and the circle, looks at the human response to difficult times as well as the good - highlighting the journey and the little moments of solitude that my footprints can lead me to. The Circle, though changing shape in each scene, is a reminder that ups and downs are constant, no matter what changes."
