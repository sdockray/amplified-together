biography: "As a Design/Commerce student I have been fascinated by materiality of objects, their life cycles, and the environment. 

This work has been inspired by visual artist Diana Scherer and the technique of fence wattling. The piece is responding to a woven metaphor ‘community living’. I wanted to show the relationship of materials, techniques and objects. Having each element intertwine to create a story. 

First, you see a gardened bed. Within this is two native Australian Climbers ‘Happy Wanderer’ (Hardenbergia). Over time these plants will creep over the woven structure. This woven structure represents the foundation of society, with the structured of the ‘old’ supporting the growth of the ‘new’. It is a metaphor for a community being able to grow and flourish based off the assistance, tools and materials of the society. Which includes, rakes, hoses, baskets and more."
