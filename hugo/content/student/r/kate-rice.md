biography: "Ewe Trace is an app designed to improve the wellbeing of both grazier and animal in relation to on farm practices within sheep farming. Working with data collected from electronic identification (EID) tags, Ewe Trace takes this data and displays it back to the user in an easy to interpret format. The ability to quickly and easily interpret their data allows graziers to maximize their productivity, the level of care provided and traceability for both a whole flock and on an individual scale. This increased level of traceability also improves farm biosecurity. Research showed that common uses for EID tags included recording pregnancy status, weight gains and various visual traits. Key limitations facing EID are current data management solutions requiring skills in Microsoft Excel to analyze and manipulate data, with one of the hardest steps in interpreting data involving the transferal of data into a meaningful format on a device."
