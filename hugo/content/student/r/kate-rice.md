biography: "Boundary line aims to challenge perceptions and expectations of boundaries within the landscape. It asks: do boundaries connect us to place or heighten our sense of disconnect or exclusion? My experience of growing up on the land in a third generation farming family frames this question. Through this work, I have engaged with themes of place and memory; seeking to materially create connections and form tangible representations of intangible emotions. 
  
 In weaving my own fence line, I have drawn from the universality of textiles and their closeness to the body. The weaving takes on a body-like quality, bulging and stretching, causing disruption in the landscape. Formed by memories and actions, our boundaries shape us. In making the piece I have retraced the fence line over and over, resulting in a well worn path along the boundary. This dynamic piece asks the viewer to walk along the fence line as well and to consider the shifting of boundaries within their own landscapes."
