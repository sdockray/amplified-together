please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Artist Ashley Roxburgh uses print media, drawing and animation to explore psychology and lived experiences of psychological disorders. This interest comes though studying a double degree in both visual arts and psychology. 
This body of work is a collection of moving images that aimed at showing what itâ€™s like to live with the psychological disorder, Visual Neglect. Visual Neglect occurs when the patient has suffered from a lesion in the brain resulting in an inability to perceive and encode half of their visual world. In order to mimic this phenomenon, I have taken everyday activities and blacked out half of the images to visually conceptualize what it would be like to live like this. The use of repetition and changing composition explore the differences in perception of reality for those with visual neglect. Blacking out different sections of the images and inclusion of 3D models represent the differences between individuals and their processing impairments."
