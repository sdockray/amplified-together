biography: "Sonification visualisation 01 is one component of an exploration into how the sonification of biodata may be translated into visual and material form, and how the development of a generative workflow made possible by computer aided design may allow for the rapid prototyping of bespoke pieces of jewellery. The form of these earrings is modelled from a sound wave generated by a physical computing prototype which detects changes in electrical conductivity over the surface of a plantâ€™s leaves and translates this data into sound.  Developed across 2021-22, this piece is symbolic of the undisciplined and inquisitive approach I take to my practice, often interrogating what possibilities arise through design methodologies and technologies."
