biography: "Sophie Ryan is an emerging artist that was born in Bathurst New South Wales. Moving to Canberra in 2017, Sophie is currently studying at The Australian National University specialising in Art History and Curatorship and Visual Arts. Sophie's current work combines the methods of drawing and painting in an active mode that documents an embodied experience. In light of the current lockdown, Sophie draws from elements in the domestic space such as coffee mugs, pot plants, and her living room. Through a series of expressive and confident mark making and layering she expresses feeling of anger, frustration and worry that were present in these uncertain times."
