biography: "This is Australian bush in middle of 2020. Trees survived through the huge bushfire and made green leaps again this year. So many people suffered from many reasons under the quarantine and fear of death. I was diagnosed depression as well and I drew this after I went out of the hospital. It was great inspiration for this work that I went to the trip with Environment Studio class. I saw not only burned black place but also green regrowths of nature. This memory and people around me kept giving me a hope to get me through my bushfire. Just as it heal me that I found some hope while seeing how nature get through the huge crisis, I wish you find your own version of hope and turn all of your burned bits into nutrients yourself."
