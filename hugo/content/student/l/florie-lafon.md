biography: "My series of four paintings called 'Bleaching Has Occurred' is my interpretation of the global crisis: Coral Bleaching. It is inspired by a documentary called 'Chasing Coral' directed by Jeff Orlowski. 
 
 The colours chosen are my memories of snorkeling and seeing all the different vibrant species of corals. The translucent painterly layers represent human destruction impacting the coral life cycle. Circles jumping across all paintings symbolize the DNA of the coral formation fighting to survive.
 
 I have combined opposing processes to explore if they work together harmoniously in a composition: for example, geometry vs gesture. One of my goals is for the paintings to have an atmospheric composition: to drive you inwards, the work coming alive and making you feel the gravity of this environmental issue. By mixing emotions of beauty and sadness, I hope to inspire wonder of what is important for future generations."
