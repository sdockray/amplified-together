biography: "Joey Lee (1999) is a multi-disciplinary Canberra-born artist undertaking a Bachelor of Visual arts, majoring in animation and video and minoring in Music Technology from the Australian National University.
 
Her main practice lies in the realm of 2D digital illustration and animation, but she  has spent the last 12 years of her life working with oil paints, watercolour and photography/cinematography.
 
Joey has a passion for creating content that can entertain her audience/make them smile. She focuses on various expressions of movement, body language and colour in her character art and still life pieces. The different emotions we perceive from music play a critical role in influencing her artworks' narratives. Her art style is shaped by the odd combination of Japanese animation and classic impressionist painters."
