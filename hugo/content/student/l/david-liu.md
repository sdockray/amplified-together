please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "I never thought I would like making wooden furniture. But from the moment I touched the fresh timber out of the thicknesser, I realised that it is the thing I endeavour for the rest of my life. I love traditional tools and using them to make hand-crafted joineries. It helped me to understand the timber better.
My practice focuses on the geometric forms and perspective view of the object, which I hope to invite people to contemplate my works and rethink it from a distinct angle."
