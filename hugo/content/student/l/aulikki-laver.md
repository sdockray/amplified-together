biography: "I am interested in a broad range of mediums and techniques, with a particular focus on printmaking and surface design. I combine a passion for science and the natural world, with a fascination for patterns, to create works that capture the beauty of animals, plants and the environment. My works also explore the concept of aesthetic through their intricate detailing, balanced compositions and meticulous colour palettes. I draw inspiration from my personal life experiences living on a farm, family interests and travelling to different places and my works often comment on global issues including matters associated with climate change and the disconnect between humans and the ecosystem."
