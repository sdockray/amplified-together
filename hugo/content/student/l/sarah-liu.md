biography: "I am interested in how people react to the impact of change, mentally and physically.
 
 Ceramics is the means I use to express myself and to explore my interest in interpersonal relationships, particularly the way in which they can be affected by external forces.
 
 In my own case, as a result of a period of trauma due to the recent civil disturbance in Hong Kong, and then being trapped in Australia during a pandemic, I have been seeking inner peace through reflection on the emotional space that really exists between people.
 
 My work therefore looks at a perfect balance between 'me' and 'we'; and a transformation from softness to hardness.
 
 Bio:
 
 Originally from Hong Kong, Sarah Liu is an artist working with ceramics with a special focus on figurative sculpture.
 
 Her practice-led research explores how individuals can achieve and maintain inner peace in the face of major external change by making connections within the emotional space between people.
 
 Sarah holds Master of Contemporary Practice in Art and Design degree from the Australian National University (2021). Her first solo exhibition is scheduled for the M16 Artspace, Canberra, in May 2022."
