biography: "Guan Yin Help You is an augmented reality (AR) headset-based scenography art that explores the topics of queerness and religion in the light of my personal experience as a queer Chinese Buddhist. The current exhibiting work includes three rendering images in portrait view from the original work. I employ mixed scenography through a combination of software for 3D modelling, animation, sound editing and scene design, using both self-made and internet sources. I explore my double identity as a queer Chinese Buddhist through the use of contrasting colours in two shrines: one takes the form of an ordinary shrine, while the other is retextured in rainbow colours as a hermeneutical expression and celebration of my queer identity. The ‘thousand-hand’ avatar of myself adopts the iconography of Thousand-Hand Guan Yin, a goddess worshipped for her altruism in helping mortals solve their problems. Replacing the original artefacts with sex-related items highlights sexual desire as both a natural human experience and a mortal problem that humans need help solving. As an outcome of my practice-based research, my work explores a new concept of mixed scenography enabled by the AR headset medium and emphasises the importance of expanding queerness and religious discourse outside centralised discussions of Christianity."
