biography: "Oceanic is an installation of 3 large immersive paintings.
Oceanic is an exploration my embodied relationship with the natural world through gestural abstraction. In the development of the work my focus are images read as both manifestations of energized paint and of inchoate matter within the natural world.
These works are painterly, almost filmic illusions of sky and water. This comes from a lived rural experience of sky, land and water with a strong connection with images of nature that are sensory and visual. Oceanic is a sensation of eternity, a feeling of being one with the external world, through gesture, chance and disorder, emotions that embrace awe, delight, and foreboding.
Bodies of water, a precious resource, are so bound to our being and survival, particularly in the context of climate change. These ideas illustrate how my project has been contextualised over time making large paintings with energy and ambition."
