biography: "Melon Shame 
Through processes of chance, instinct, and control I dissected language through fictional texts written by male authors about female subjects into narrative strings and loops generating further texts of varied coherence. The meanings stay ambiguous which creates the insular malleability. There is a genealogy of texts informing further texts as they interact with each other creating an interrelated sense, to taste words and see thoughts in a shifting spectrum becoming an expanded synaesthesia. Conceptual cognates and sense cognates are generated through the materiality of language and selection of written flavours. The works live in oscillating physical, mental, aural, and digital spaces, and these mediums become spaces are transmuted.  
In using my female voice there is a spoken and written mirror phase: a female voice performing text generated from male authors, then read by a machine with an artificial male voice creating an interchange of the gendered voice."
