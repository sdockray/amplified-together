biography: "Coming from the perspective of wanting to embrace these unconventional social behaviours which previously ostracised by others. ‘Puppet Hands’ tries to replicate at sensation of a conversation you don’t quite understand. 
A pseudo moment of intense bodily and non-verbal analysis; the obscenity of gesture leaves itself up to interpretation for the audience to figure out of what is the actual truth of this gathering is.
Inspired by surreal experiences of body language and mimicry that many people with ASD go through. Where hands are one vessel people can relate to universally, and the viewer many feel the compulsion to copy these gestures to intern understanding them better."
