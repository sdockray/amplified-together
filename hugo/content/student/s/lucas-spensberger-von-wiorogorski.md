biography: "The prototype sphere is an exploration into a renewable energy generator disguised as a contemporary public art that is aesthetically pleasing, can be embedded harmoniously into the landscape and successfully incorporates art with current technological solutions. 

To support the wider community and especially the socially disadvantaged like homeless people the sphere provides the option for USB charging and light at night. The larger spheres in size can provide shelter and seating. 

The sphere is made of recycled and sustainable materials that are long lasting and hardy such as recycled timber and plastics. They can be obtained locally from waste centres and reutilized."
