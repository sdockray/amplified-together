biography: "In the past two years, I have commonly used 3D modeling, photography, and video as media to create works. In order to connect them with humanistic politics and explore how to use them as a medium to explore the inner connection between digital art and contemporary art. Additionally means to express complex social concepts.
 
 'Stagnation' is my new exploration video installation. I used several footage documentaries 3D modeling and stop motion and combine my background as a Chinese to create this work. In 'Stagnation' I link a new Chinese social concept 'neijuan' as the basis, (The Chinese term 'neijuan' is composed of the words internal and rolling, implying a process of inward curling, trapping participants into the unending self-circulation) to explore the relationship between 'neijuan' and utopia. Also explores the relationship among people, society, and power. Circle and square musk are important elements in this work. Square and circle symbolize rules and systems in Chinese culture. From these Shaped videos, we can see the control of capital and politics over people, as well as the wind gap between our system and utopia."
