please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Pearson's work has explored themes of intimacy, vulnerability, and the relationship one has with their own body and sense of identity. She renders these themes through generous applications of oil paint to wooden board, favouring oils for their rich colour, vibrancy, and ability to draw the viewer further into the depth of the piece. Pearson's graduating piece, Touch, explores the unique relationship between a collection of adults who consented to photograph themselves from their homes during the height of the pandemic. Arranging these people in a collage-style painting allowed these strangers, separated by distance and circumstance, to be completely vulnerable with each other. The act of nudity is extremely intimate, sensitive, and fragile. Through these current unique circumstances, she has been able to unify people who would never normally interact with strangers in such an exposed way."
