biography: "While I have experience in multidisciplinary work, my primary practice is painting. My interest is in the human experience, and the way humans interact with both each other and their environment. Although this often includes elements of social justice, in every work I am to reflect the mundanities and authenticities of humanity. 

This artwork examines the relationship between individuals and identity groups, and the limitations of modern conceptions of identity. The artwork challenges the agency of the individual in defining their own identity, in relation to the group. In particular, my artwork studies the experiences of those who live at the intersection of queer sexuality and religious identities. While these two spheres are at the forefront of discussions around identity politics, the assumption remains that they are largely distinct. In my work, I hope to shed light on those individuals whose struggles with identity are likely to be overlooked, and therefore raise questions about other such cases in society."
