biography: "Reimagining medical procedures, interventions and associated apparatus, this series seeks to transform the experiences of a wounded body into moments of wonder and playful exploration. Glassblowing is a method that allows the artist to be present in the moment of transformation and through active engagement with the material, seek to intervene in the same way medical procedures are performed on the human body. Drawing together amorphic forms conceived through breath, motionand manipulation; glass is interrupted, pierced, distorted, held or encased. The subject of further manipulation, some of these forms are then slumped in the kiln over multiple firings, supported by hand-built clay elements as they melt. Here, the artist is left speculating the outcome, having been removed from direct influence. Encountering the final work, the viewer witnesses the careful reconstruction of symbiosis between the body and the external components it is dependent upon. Challenging notions of beauty often associated with glass, these installations capture the dissonance between distress and awe, between the body as personal or medical, seeking to realise the potential for transformation in these moments of pain."
