biography: "This body of work addresses a deep feeling and knowing of a particular place that is now lost. Drawing on my memories and a layering of experiences, sculptural objects evoke a familiarity of my childhood home on the N.S.W. south coast.The utter destruction caused by bush fire was a painful reminder of the temporality of life. It is through the molten flow of kiln formed glass that I want to evoke the transient and impermanent nature of all things. I explore the cyclical nature of the natural world and the never-ending story of time feeding back on itself and the eternal cycle of birth, death and renewal."
