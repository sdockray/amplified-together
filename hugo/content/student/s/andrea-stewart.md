biography: "Spell Me This' is a tabletop game designed to construct an experience which challenges the normalized ways of decoding language. Education pathways which normalize neurotypical literacy comprehension have led to the stigmatization of learning differences and the underdiagnoses of Dyslexia in Australia. 'Spell Me This' aims to place neurotypical learners into a framework which challenges their process of decoding language. By using gamification 'Spell Me This' evokes an empathetic response in its players by challenging them to decode language in frameworks which do not cater for their cognitive comprehension of letter forms, mirroring the experience of students with a learning difference. 
 This game is tangible and encourages creativity but can elicit frustration which builds a personal understanding of the difficulties of learning in a system which does not support your literary comprehension processes."
