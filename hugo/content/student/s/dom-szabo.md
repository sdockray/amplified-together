biography: "Hello! My name is Domonkos Szab√≥, I'm currently graduating from my flexible double degree in Art History and Curatorship, and Classical Studies.  What interests me about art history is how artworks open windows into the lives and cultures of past societies and how the meaning and value of objects change over time.  I specialise in Greco-Roman as well as West and South Asian art, with a particular interest in antiquities trafficking and cultural heritage management in conflict zones."
