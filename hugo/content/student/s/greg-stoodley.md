biography: "I am a photographer and artist who enjoys playing with aesthetics and materials from photography's past and integrating them with digital media. I have a distinct love for black and white photography and analogue processes. The work you're about to see was made in 2021. The overriding theme of the work is exploring the relationship of the photographic image to time, especially as that relates to culture and its relationship to photography. In a world where all forms of media are saturated with colour, pointed questions are asked about the relevance and use of black and white in contemporary practice. The following work reads as a manifesto."
