biography: "Anna Stewart-Yates is a Bachelor of Art History and Curatorship (Honours) student. Her thesis is titled ‘Modernist Japanese-ness: A Genealogy of Intercultural Design Exchange’. As encountered in design for the home today, the ideas of ‘Japanese-ness’ and ‘modernism’ are twins. Born together in the early twentieth century, the DNA of the one is encoded with that of the other. By placing the example of Yanagi Soetsu’s mingei theory alongside Frank Lloyd Wright’s domestic architecture, Anna’s thesis illustrates the layered matrices of influence, reflexivity and reinterpretation which characterised early twentieth-century intercultural design exchange. These processes and relationships produced the present phenomenon whereby extant ideas of ‘Japanese-ness’ and ‘the modern home’ are uncannily similar – not because one ‘copied’ or ‘appropriated’ the ‘original’ or ‘authentic’ source, but because each co-gestated with the other. Through this ‘way of seeing’ Anna’s research seeks to destabilise the normativity of the present and reveal alternative possibilities for future research."
