please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Of Ailsa seeks to explore the concept of the bedroom as a space of connection and of relationships between private and public. This is because I believe the bedroom plays an amplified role in our current state of the coronavirus pandemic.
First and foremost, it is a place of rest, recharge and relaxation Now, it is also my art studio and workspace, and the place where I will finish my university degree. It is where I engage with the big wide world online,and communicate with friends and family. Where I blog, journal, and make phone calls. Where I sleep and online date. Where I plan my future. Where I have job interviews. Where I self isolate and social distance. Where I Zoom and Microsoft Teams my classmates. One place, many roles."
