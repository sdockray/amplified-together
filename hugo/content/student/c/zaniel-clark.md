biography: "Nestled in bed and surrounded by objects performing an improvised bedroom scene, I read from a stack of loose papers a prose poem of queer reckoning and confession. In Everyone, Everything: Queer confession and coming out aesthetics, queer confession —particularly the act of coming out —is understood through processes of performance, writing, and documentary. I borrow from Foucault’s definition of the confession as inherently about power relationships, that being the disparities of control between the one confessing and the other, acting both as interlocuter and, critically, as ultimate authority. By this definition, Everyone, Everything is able to play all roles in the act of confession: the performance as the act itself; the performer as its object; and the prose as its subject. Together these elements explore how coming out as the self-disclosure of identity could, even within these power relationships, produce in itself effects of liberation or emancipation.

Within each of these elements, Everyone, Everything further aims to investigate ways in which coming out may be expressed both visually and textually. Whether through the symbolism of the bed and bedroom aesthetics, or in the stream-of-consciousness presented in the writing, the work begins to question what an aesthetics of coming out could look like."
