biography: "I have become increasingly interested in the content we choose to display within digital spaces. Within my personal digital circles, multiple images of figures interject and converge through similar landscapes, and social groups.  A specific place and relationship are not merely represented but become created within these virtual spaces.  This idea prompted me to explore digital imagery as a creative entry into painting. The paintings began with a process of compiling imagery from my digital circles, digitally manipulating these through layering and stitching together seemingly connected timelines. I then re-contextualise this back into the physical space of painting through choices in multilayered glazes and shifting image planes. I hope to evoke an aesthetic that speaks to the oscillation between figuration and abstraction, to point to moments of intimacy and distance that characterises this technological age."
