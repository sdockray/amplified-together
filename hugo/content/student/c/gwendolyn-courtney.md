please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "My design interests really revolves around the object. Recently I have been specifically exploring sustainability in the textile industry with a focus on reusability rather than recycling. I was struck by the reliance on the idea of ‘recycling’, its marketed as an environmental saviour. However I see it as an afterthought. We should instead stop creating so much waste.  

My solution was to design a series of interlocking links that could be assembled, disassembled and reconfigured. Allowing for broken or faulty parts of the objects to be removed and replaces without the death of an item. Also challenging our ever changing preferences in appearance with its ability to be reconfigured. This solution relied on repetitious patterns to function, but I found this created hypnotic visual aesthetics, the idea has limitless scope for pattern generation with variation in material type and colour."
