biography: "This Thermo-responsive Handle reveals the invisible temperature relationship between people and objects in a mesmerizing display of colour.
 
 The purpose of highlighting this user-object relationship is to empower mundane objects like handles to respond and reflect their user, demanding attention where they would usually be unnoticed.
 
 This handle is designed with a cylindrical form to be comfortable and maximize the surface area touched by the hand. 3D printed, painted black and then counted in thermochromic ink; the handle appears black until touched (or heat is applied), which is when the thermochromic ink comes to life, outlining exactly where the hand has touched the handle with an array of colour.
 
 This thermo-responsive handle traces interaction visually, echoing the user in colour. Diverting the eye, this handle is autonomous in its ability to reflect its use. This reaction is ephemeral and forgetful, returning to its normal black surface after time."
