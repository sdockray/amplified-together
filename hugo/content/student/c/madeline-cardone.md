biography: "My work explores an embodied experience of architectural space through performance and object. I draw on ideas about architectural phenomenology and a personal experience of architecture to inform my material processes. This current body of work investigates the window structures of Flynn Primary School. I particularly work with black glass to evoke the phenomenological qualities of shadow, volume and void, which are experienced by the body in the space through movement and interaction. My practice continues to challenge the conventions of control and refinement in kiln formed glass. In this body of work, I allow the material to be autonomous in its response to the space it is being formed by, embracing the material outcomes as objects of uncertainty."
