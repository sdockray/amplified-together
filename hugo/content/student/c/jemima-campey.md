biography: "Jemima Campey (Ngunnawal/Ngambri lands, Australia) makes photos, performances, installations and films. Through the use of appropriated and reworked materials which are borrowed from a day-to-day context, she touches various overlapping themes and strategies, such as performance, memory, and popular culture. Utilising art as a means of self-exploration, Campey's text and photographic works are often deeply personal, providing insight into the act of making art in contemporary culture."
