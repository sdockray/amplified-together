biography: "Jemima Campey (Ngunnawal/Ngambri lands, Australia) makes photos, performances, installations and films. Through the use of appropriated and reworked materials which are borrowed from a day-to-day context, she touches various overlapping themes and strategies, such as performance, memory,  and contemporary culture. Utilising art as a means of self-exploration, Campeyâ€™s text and photographic works are often deeply personal, providing insight into the act of making art in contemporary culture.  
Jemima graduated from the Australian National University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Arts (English) and a Bachelor of Visual Arts (Photomedia), and completed her Bachelor of Visual Arts Honours in 2022."
