biography: "We naturally try to separate surfaces - we discern a tree from its setting, and each of its branches and leaves we can categorise into surface, shape, texture and colour. Childs is interested in disrupting this ability to filter. She uses painted paper that is pressed onto the canvas to create additive layers - nothing is scraped away once on the canvas to challenge assumptions of mark-making.  By creating highly layered surfaces that combine paper, text and acrylic paint, she explores the potential of painting to invite endless possibilities and uses this as a tool to reject the idea of a singular reality. 

The corner serves to create a space where the viewer's peripheries are filled with the noise of the painting. Through the display, Childs hopes to encourage viewers to find relationships between the paintings and to acknowledge that every whole is made up of many elements that could shift at any moment."
