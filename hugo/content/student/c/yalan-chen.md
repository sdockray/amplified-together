biography: "Yalan’s research focuses on exploring human connectedness with nature. Yalan was awarded ‘First Place Prize’ in 2022 ANU Student Research Conference by presenting the research process of this body of paintings. She is part of ‘ANU Freilich project ‘We Bleed The Same’ master classes to promote equality. These paintings were created based on studies conducted at the Australian National Botanic Garden.
 
‘Physically, I want to help contributing to sustainability practice such as seed saving. Each colour used referred to a specific native floral species studied from the botanic garden. Spiritually, I want to explore a path to heal human and nature alienation. I captured some invisible floral energies I felt in the Garden and translated them into lines and dots. I hope to shift our world into a mutually nurturing system. Theories and philosophies influenced my work include deep ecology theory, Taoism, Symbiocene philosophy, universal consciousness, plant thinking and panpsychism.'

 ‘My body of work explores human connectedness with Nature. Human are organic beings created by Nature. As mentioned in classical Taoism text ‘The Secrete of Golden Flower’, human spirits are consists of the Primordial Soul and the Material Soul, the ‘Hun’ 魂 and ‘Po’ 魄. The ‘Primordial Soul’ came from the source of the consciousness of Universe while the ‘Material Soul’ came from material world. I attempt to reunite the Primordial Soul with the origin by immersing myself with invisible floral energies from nature. ’"
