please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "I grew up in a small rural town on the south coast of New South Wales. Moruya is surrounded by bushland on one side and the coastline on the other. It was one of the towns hit by the 2019/2020 summer bushfires, burning just meters from my home. Due to Covid-19 I spent time at home with my family. This time enabled me to sort through my feelings and emotions while immersing myself in the local bushland where I saw the bush regrow and regenerate. 
I created a series of works on paper using brushes I made from things I collected in the bush around the old overgrown Moruya tip. The works reflected my changing feelings, which began with grief and sadness and shifted to hope and happiness as I saw the bush come back to life. I walked everyday collecting objects and recording the sounds of birds and other wildlife."
