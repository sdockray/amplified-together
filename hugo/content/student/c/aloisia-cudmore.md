please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Living Inside Intimacy explores intimacy in the age of COVID-19. The artwork originated as an installation for my Honours Thesis Assessment, which then transformed into purely digital art. 

Through the following website there are installation photographs and videos of the physical artwork. In addition to this, the website showcases the digital artwork that I have created. 

The installation itself consists of a small living room set up in a gallery. Upon closer inspection you move in to see an iPhone playing a looping video. The video included in the installation depicts a finger swiping frantically through a large number of photographs taken on my phone. The photographs form an intimate dataset that navigates a virtual map of my persona environments: home and workplace (a supermarket). Together, they can be considered as an architecture of intimate space. Both of these spaces became the main landscapes of the 2020 pandemic."
