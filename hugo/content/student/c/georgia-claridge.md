biography: "Georgia Claridge is an upcoming Canberra based artist in the final year of her Bachelor of Visual Arts and Science at the Australia National University. Primarily working in paint, her works explore the absurdity of the everyday through the lens of personal narrative. 

1.2 million explores the inner world of my family home through a series of deconstructed rooms at a 1:10 scale. The work depicts remnants of the past as singular, fragile moments of sound, as the occupants undergo the painful process packing up and moving out. Tensions between the hidden, private and presented, public space are revealed as the viewer delves deeper into the secret recesses of the house. These rooms reveal to the viewer memories reflective of the private intensity of the occupants everyday lives and memorialise their longing for the past. The miniature scale reflects the intimacy of the work as the viewer partakes in a voyeuristic, open-house experience. Reflecting on the commodification of home into real-estate, the work asks the viewer to inspect the property as it is presented and consider the value of their own home."
