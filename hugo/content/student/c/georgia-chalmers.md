My work Metamorphosis follows the natural growth cycle of a butterfly as a metaphor and symbol for embodied trauma and healing. For this work, challenged with two-dimensional representation in photography, I combined multiple mediums, and allowed for a more sculptural and material representation of these complex embodied experiences. As someone with an invisible disability, drawing inspiration from disabled artists such as Frida Kahlo has allowed me to create my own language to express and help others understand the journey of trauma, chronic illness and femininity within patriarchal institutions.The surrealist movement and their inspiration from unconscious symbols and contents, have inspired me to relate experiences connecting the mind and body through symbols and self portraiture. The use of boxes and glass windows represent oppressive systems, observing and abstracted, which I have taken into my own hands, and adorned with the symbols of my inner experience of pain, healing and identity. In Ancient Greece the word for Butterfly was Psyche, which means soul. Psyche represents the birth of a new outlook, and the beginning of the healing process."
