biography: "In this mid-digital age, we already live in an emerging world with digital technology. New generations are live among with the virtual world. Digital technology become necessity for our communication these days. This artwork is the visualization of 4-dimensional world in my imaginary perspective. As humanities are able to upload their spirits as a data into the 4-dimensional form. This world could be manipulatable to a extends of human creativity. I personally loves the illustration of mixing reality and virtual illustration.
 
 In the discovery of human capability higher dimension are always exist in other form of energy or spiritual. Only to the limitation of human sensation we say there is only one time past, present and future. Our dreams, visions, longings, recalling's of the past, traumas, imaginations, they too are alive. Therefore 4-Dimensional space should allow individuals to travel teleports in any timeframe and space. My work is to illustrates how 4D world will be visualized and demonstrates in a 2D form. The aim are to presents a journey take the audiences travelling though the 4D worlds to feel experience a totally different perspective. Most importantly to evoke the audience with the feeling of high-tech and cybernetical generation is on its way to emerge with current situation. As we step into post-covid situation out lifestyle is already changed by the pandemic. More population relies on digital technology."
