biography: "Sanne Carroll (b. 1997) lives and works on Ngunnawal/Ngambri land (Canberra). Her practice-led research involves interdisciplinary collaboration between the visual arts and STEM fields. 
 
 'Can I ask you a maths question?' is an interdisciplinary collaborative project that explores methodologies in drawing and mathematics in the construction of patterned grids. The work begins with coloured grids drawn by hand, which are given to mathematicians to interpret and produce an algorithmic response. The project explores what is exchanged in the translation from human to algorithmic grids in terms of the grid's materiality, but also in the exchange of language and knowledge that arises from interdisciplinary collaborative work. As the grids, algorithms and collaborative relationships evolve, shared understandings of foreign concepts are developed and translated between languages of mathematics and drawing."
