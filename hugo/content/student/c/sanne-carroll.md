please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Sanne Carroll (b. 1997 Canberra) is a Canberra based artist currently undertaking a Bachelor of Visual Arts at the Australian National University. Working in drawing, her work explores feminist geographies, particularly concerning womenâ€™s safety in urban spaces.  Often working with pencil and slow, repetitive mark making, her laborious process mirrors the work involved in navigating the social issues that she is concerned with.  Recent exhibitions include Micro Macro (CSIRO 2018) and Life and Breath (ANU School of Art and Design, 2019). In 2019, Carroll was commissioned to create a series of eight panels for Daramalan College, for display at various events and ceremonies. Her work resides in private collections."
