biography: "The aim of my graduating work which combines my loves of nature and of music was to explore ways that an artwork could be activated by the environment to create sound. The objects which employ the mechanism of an Aeolian Harp, a bygone musical instrument, are designed for outdoor installation and are activated by the wind to produce gentle harmonic frequencies. The listener is invited to embrace these unpredictable sounds in combination with the naturally occurring soundscape of wind, birds and insects. 
 The work explores the interconnectedness between people and the natural environment. By offering this multi sensorial work, installed within the Mount Majura Nature Reserve, I hope to encourage the viewer to consider this interconnection and to reflect upon our responsibility to preserve and protect our natural spaces and the creatures that reside within them. Due to the current Covid restrictions, the work has been documented using film and audio to recreate the intended ambiance of the outdoor experience."
