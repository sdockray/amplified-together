The design as a commercial product that strengthens private ownership and weaves the ideation into personal identity, thus raising awareness of the impact of technology on future employment. 
BACKGROUND In 2045, technology has taken over 90% of the workforce. Sam, a member of the human workforce, could not keep up with the pace of work and is fired. Without a stable job, Sam is identified by the Urban Security AI System as an unstable population that threat to society and security, thus they send an AI Moving Kit to force Sam to leave the smart city. The next day the AI Moving Kit arrives at Sam’s home and transmits all the data and transform into a handbag. Although, Sam tries to destroy the AI Bag, the AI Bag detects Sam’s intentions and warns him not to resist."
