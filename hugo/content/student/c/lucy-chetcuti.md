biography: "Lucy Chetcuti is an emerging visual artist based on unceded Ngunnawal/Ngambri land, ACT. 
 
 Lucy predominantly makes two and three-dimensional abstract works using found objects and non-traditional materials, she is interested in the prosaic as a means of examining the semiotic relationship between people and their objects of value. Her work traverses the space between painting, drawing, sculpture and installation. The scope of her work includes themes of Queer ecology, Queer theory, Feminism, Phenomenology and Materialism. Lucy was a board member of Tributary Projects Artspace between 2017 - 2020. In 2021 she won the ANU School of Art and Design Drawing Prize. Her work is held in private collections in Australia. 
 
 Lucy seeks to question spatial hierarchies in the gallery and 'the aesthetic encounter'. Lucy makes work that explores the trauma of ecocide in this current moment. She emphasises the materiality of prosaic objects, industrial materials and discarded artefacts as meaningful."
