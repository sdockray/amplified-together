biography: "Tragedy is a game designed to play with Common-Pool Resources. These are resources which are shared but cannot be easily protected. In Tragedy four players compete to be the first to connect four paths. Each path is made by taking resources from a common pool. This pool grows by only one quarter each round. 

The capacity for players to over extract resources from a common pool is known as the Tragedy of the Commons. In its basic form this game provides opportunities for players to discuss, ally or sanction the actions of others. After reflecting on the outcomes of these actions the game then provides players the opportunity to write their own rules. 

As the rules of the game develop through this cycle of action and reflection players engage in the process of Governing the Commons referring to the work of political economist Elinor Ostrom. The mechanics of Tragedy provides an opportunity to explore how reflection, incompleteness and interaction might support the development of shared language and goals."
