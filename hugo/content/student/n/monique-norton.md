biography: "Nightly Disconnect explores how the overuse of screens has affected our sleep and invaded our thoughts. The focus of this collection of animations is on that moment just before sleep when we must put down our phones, but all of their contents are still sitting in our heads, keeping us awake longer and ruining our sleep quality. Each animation reveals a new view of a nightly routine, expressed through a series of exposed paintings. A way for the mind to relax is gradually presented towards the end of the series as elements of nature are introduced; through connecting with the environment and staying away from digital influences, the mind can be at rest."
