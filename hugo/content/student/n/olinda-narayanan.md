please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Spatial Connections explores boundary making through weaving. The mutual dependency of soft indigo dyed thread and wooden structural supports creates an architectural tension. Which ultimately seeks to create new opportunities for people to interact with each other and with the build environment. In Drifting in One Place, this tension can be engaged with at a human scale, encouraging reflection on the coexisting boundaries and connections both in our interpersonal relationships and in space.  Have Our Being is activated by touch, this small-scale work opens a further tension between the boundaries of a propositional architectural model and a resolved artwork."
