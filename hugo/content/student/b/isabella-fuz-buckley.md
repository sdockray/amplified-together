biography: "I always find emotion something difficult to deal with and contain, sometimes it feels more like I'm hiding something that controlling it. This, at least for me, is a cathartic expression of that emotion that just cant escape me, that which I feel in all parts of my self, and all parts of the space I inhabit. Perhaps I'm a bit indulgent by making a work where it's goal is to help me work though my own issues around control and catharsis, explore this fear I have of an animalistic id that I pretend doesn't exists. Somehow I'm trying to put my mindscape down on the page, because I'm sure its not a unique experience."
