biography: "My design project 'Threemodel' explores the promotion of accessibility and interactivity in the museum experience, by utilising 3D modelling and printing technologies. These techniques allow for a tangible experience with objects and artefacts, bringing them into the hands of the public, as part of interactive exhibits and outreach programs. 
 
 Furthermore, the inherent material properties/process of the technology allow exploration of ideas concerning the re-creation and rebuilding of damaged or delicate artefacts, providing a new life to the unseen or unknown aspects of history.
 
 The project consists of 3D printed busts of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep III, in original, reconstructed, and interactive puzzle states. These works are also housed, along with process documentation and rationale, in website form.
 
 Developed across 2020-1, Threemodel merges the knowledge, skills, research and interest I have acquired across the fields of Digital Humanities and Design during my studies."
