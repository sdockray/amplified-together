please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "I explore and examine the absurd in visual art by experimenting with painting and animation. Through the lens of our digital world, I use two and three dimensional elements within paintings to push the boundaries of how we perceive casual interactions from behind a screen. My work addresses humanity’s instinct to turn to the comfort of humour when reality becomes too harsh. I am interested in contrasting flat and raised surfaces, as well as matte and glossy finishes. Following a painting’s completion, I further investigate the process by reintroducing it back into a cybernated world as I animate digitally. I am interested in making work that tells a story, and moments frozen in time."
