biography: "Throughout 2021, I have considered the relationships between figure and place to explore the domestic human condition and the desire to form human connections. My paintings attempt to visualise moments of suburban mundanity, capturing vulnerable, solitary moments in a world that demands a spectacle. My paintings explore the uncanny and the eerie dimensions of life to exaggerate the sense of displacement found within domestic and urban liminal spaces. Working with oil and acrylic paints, I reinterpret photographic material to construct pictorial narratives. Each painting engages with the domestic scene, describing isolated figures who inhabit private interiors and exterior urban environments that have been forever changed by a human presence."
