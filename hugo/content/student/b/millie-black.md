please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Grounding Atmospheres tracks the conscious and subconscious marks of the human in nature. In my practice, I explore the dualisms that detach the human from nature brought about by the cultural construct of the ‘Wilderness’ ideal. To dissolve this figure-ground separation that has outlined the tradition of Western landscape painting, I explore the purpose of ground and air in connecting ourselves to the environment by using earth pigments and plant dyes from the landscape I work with. Grounding Atmospheres removes an anthropocentric view of the land and explores the deep layers of the air and the ground by bringing an awareness to our breathing and dependence on nature. This is presented through the unwoven negative space and the supple nature of the cloth and fibres. In this, I hope to promote a greater awareness of the air and the importance of seeing ourselves as part of nature."
