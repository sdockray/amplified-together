biography: "My artistic practice utilises studio glass to convey an exploration of forms that derive from specific aero and hydrodynamic surfaces. These are the key aesthetic elements helping drive my work, along with the evolutionary developments in both nature and synthetic forms that have adapted to their relevant environments. Each piece contemplates the use of forms that are not yet sculpturally anticipated. Allowing for a unique formal approach to glass making. Utilising common hotshop techniques, then employing a range of further developed machine and tool applications in the coldshop including cutting, grinding and polishing, to the work's surface. Referencing physical qualities that are otherworldly and alien by nature. Glass' ability to convey light through varying density of abstract and streamlined silhouettes, pushes the viewer to explore the dynamic relationship of optics present in the work. As some of the more highly polished surfaces encapsulate to viewer while softer opaque finishes glow as light becomes trapped in the surface. In combination with a vibrant jewel tone palette elevating the presence of the work with a dynamic relationship between forms."
