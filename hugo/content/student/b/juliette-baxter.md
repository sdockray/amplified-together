biography: "My work seeks to make sense of my family history and origins in the wake of transracial adoption and multiple migrations and present an alternative type of family portrait of diaspora in the digital age. I explore how painting, collage and assemblage combine in non-traditional compositions to understand my peripheral relationship to family and place of origin. 

From my perspective as the child of an adoptee and the third generation of my family born outside China, I investigate the tensions in forging reconnection after long-term, multi-generational loss while also finding my own place to belong. Drawing from internet-based research into my family histories and realities, I attempt to reclaim family history through reviving historical artefacts in an installation. Through painting, image transfers, and an assemblage of found objects, I illustrate how screen-based research permeates into real life."
