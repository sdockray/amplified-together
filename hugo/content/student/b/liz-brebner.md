please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "My spatial art practice is often inspired by cultural ideas and theories. My making process involves playing with different formats to bring an artwork to fruition. My art practice can be described as experimental play in a local everyday environment. I try to highlight what is conventionally unseen background noise by bringing it into the foreground.  

My artwork 'unofficial walking' (www.unofficialwalking.com) is a walk on the Australian National University campus and highlights barriers on campus.  When a person encounters a barrier in their life it requires action, be it physical or psychological. The action might be to witness and abide by the barrier, or it might be to traverse the barrier and transgress its instruction or to shift the barrier altogether. The walk shows barriers on campus that are conventionally unseen by people because they are obvious and have become a known part of our everyday lives. Barriers are so embedded in our everyday lives we barely notice their effect. 

My artwork requires active participation by people using mobile phones and the internet. There is a google geocache trail throughout the walk and video footage that shows how people's activities change the way places on campus are used. These include the Canberra parkour community and students using the local carpark as a practice site. These people have used their agency to overcome the barriers of conformity and playfully found ways to change the way a place is used."
