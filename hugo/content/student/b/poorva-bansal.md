please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Devised during lockdown in Melbourne, Community Projects sought to minimise the effect of social distancing and create a platform for community involvement and collective art making. Conforming to the Covid-19 restrictions, I worked within the five kilometre radius of my house, hand posting invitations to participate. The instructions were simple and accessible, with the aim of finding ways to bring people together in solidarity in the present and in hope for the future."
