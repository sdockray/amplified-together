biography: "The central aim of my project is to develop a framework for storytelling through data visualisation with a data humanism approach. The work is coupled with a focus on the COVID19 pandemic in the year 2020 and the ensuing cultural shifts in the year 2021. The visualisations take the form of cartogram maps and are illustrated alongside news headlines and notes of personal narratives. Building on the initial brief of the project, monthly Sydney Morning Herald collages and additional drawings are also featured on the site. The project's aim is to reimagine the role of data visualisation and promote discussion regarding international travel and freedom of movement among the viewer. Zoe Anika is a multimedia contemporary artist with a current focus on printmaking and drawing."
