please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "My body of work entitled ‘are you going to keep that?’ is my response to the Covid 19 pandemic, limitations on travel and freedom of movement and the resulting nostalgia felt for past memories, places, and experiences. The suite of drawings created uses travel ephemera to explore the prescribed memory associated with these items. The work began in March at the precipice of the global pandemic, using genuine items accumulated throughout the seven months I spent abroad in late 2019 early 2020. The final works I selected are pieces from locations hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic; Italy, the US and the UK. The centre piece of the collection is a Qantas plane ticket from Tokyo to Sydney (mid February 2020), just as the Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantining in Japan. The work deals with the pandemic becoming a genuine fear, hence the receipt for a German Apotheke for the purchased of an N95 mask (30 January 2020)."
