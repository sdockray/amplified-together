biography: "This series of quilts started as an exercise to provide calm and solace during the turbulence of 2020. Over the months the construction of the quilts evolved into an act of defiance against our societyâ€™s current mass production culture. Many of the pieces are made from scavenged fabrics from a place I regularly explore, a dumping site between the Jerrabomberra wetlands nature reserve and the Fyshwick railway. Through the slow process of scavenging, repairing and ultimately quilting I aspire to transform these abandoned, dumped and displaced materials into objects that have the ability to hold sentiment."
