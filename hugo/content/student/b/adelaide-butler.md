biography: "In times such as these in which our lives are dominated by constant streams of information and 24-hour news alerts, where can we find sources of comfort and rest? Both embroidery and reading, as solitary and contemplative practices, produce a space where the individual can escape into their imagination while staying grounded by the soft touch of fabric or the weight of a book. Through the labour of their creation, these small moments are acknowledged, validated, and celebrated, while drawing attention to the skewed way we perceive time.      
	These physical manifestations of slow, viewer activated animation, encourage an experience of stillness and peace. Tiny movements can be revealed with the turning of each cloth page, drawing the audience into the slow action of reading, and allow audiences to catch glimpses into honest moments in the lives of others, connecting with them through a physically mirroring experience. This experience offers a shared intimacy and connection between audience and subject across time and space."
