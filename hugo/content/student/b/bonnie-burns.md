biography: "Desire goes beyond simply wanting; itâ€™s a need that is bodily, soulful, inherent and inevitable. 

I desire for my time to be spent in a manner I see as worthwhile. 
I desire for those I love to achieve success. 
I desire for my creativity to be productive, enjoyable and connective.

In five one-on-one conversations over a cheeky bev, I asked the people I value point blank what they desired. In voicing our independent ambitions, conversation empowered an energy exchange, mutual motivation and connection. 
Now we wear the evidence of this process in merch that regrounds us in our aspirations; animating them as we work, eat, study, dance, sleep and approach their realisation."
