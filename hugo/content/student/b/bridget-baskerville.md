please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Art is the Void' is a portrait of my hometown of Kandos; a small, rural, post-industrial town in New South Wales. A focus on the history of empty spaces and forgotten rooms is enlivened with my local knowledge of place and community. Through the act of telling stories and turning pages, this work is an exploration of my relationship to the town, the community, my family and to my grandmother, who passed away last year. Art is the Void has emerged from my time spent in my hometown in 2020, due to the social isolation of Covid-19. Being in Kandos has coincided with the selling of my nanâ€™s house, an experience that has led me to reminisce about all the stories she used to tell."
