please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "As an artist, I aim to produce imagery and associations that bounce around creating new connections. I'm interested in an overloaded visual experience and artworks that envelop the viewer. Our mind often has many thoughts all competing for our attention and so do my paintings. I conjure into the world vivid dreamscapes and anchor down the fleeting aesthetics of psychedelia. I aim to break out what sits in our subconscious and investigate microcosms, getting to better understand what weaves the threads of our reality. In my exhibition Frequency Plane, each painting pulls the viewer into a portal, investigating new worlds, mindscapes and associations."
