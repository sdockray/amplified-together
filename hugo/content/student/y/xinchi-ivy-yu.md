biography: "I am a graphic designer studying ANU. I started my bachelor degree on 2017. During my studying, my foundation courses focused on basic graphic designing skills, including designing principles and computer software skills. And I also tried multi-disciplinary things e.g. furniture, gold and silver smithing, laser cutting. I'm continuing trying new techniques that better help my creation. And I started thinking about the engagement with audiences like a commercial artist. I'm using I want my artworks to be seen rather than understood by myself only."
