biography: "My practice examines how social and technological advancements distort and amplify our sense of self and our place in society. Accordingly, my Honours research responds to the loss of the proximate and the physical as an underlying condition of the pandemic. To do this, I worked with reproduction apparatuses that record and reposition the voice as a political tool that can be used to enact dismissed rituals.
 
 The project culminated in three performances that use 'Empathy Apparatuses' to extend my capacity to approach and make space for incomprehensibility. Although the research was motivated by the loss of my grandmother and the inability to mourn her passing, this body of work ultimately addresses loss as more than the death of a family member. Instead, it considers how we learn to sit with loss during the cultural turn towards disembodiment and within the Anthropocene, which views our current epoch as one deeply implicated in oscillating extremes in social change and extinction events."
