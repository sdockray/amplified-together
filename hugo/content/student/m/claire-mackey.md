biography: "This series explores and aims to celebrate image creation processes employed by the fashion industry. Mundane everyday objects and locations are creatively transformed by adopting editorial fashion and art historical pictorial design elements. This achieves an editorial fashion look heavily associated with fashion imagery, that many in society idolise. 
 
 The diptych pair composition evokes comparison similar to 'Instagram vs reality' posts, but in painted form. In recent times, mass availability and rapid consumption of stylised commercial imagery have lead to lazy viewing habits. Even clear realistic imagery can be misinterpreted and oddities unnoticed despite hiding in plain sight. 
 
 This project calls viewers to scrutinise aspects of fashion imagery that we might normally gloss over. It highlights that expensive 'designer' items and fancy locations are not required. Instead the look can be achieved through resourcefulness with what you have, creative thinking, good angles and lighting that the fashion industry knows so well."
