please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "I search for profundity and detail in complex concepts, and present aesthetic objects as proof.

In my current investigation of light, colour, and vision, I am creating a method of form finding to mathematically describe the experience of seeing existing glass art objects, transformed in a new virtual and material dimensionality.

This involves measuring the colour of a piece of glass art using a device that outputs colour data, which is then processed through out-sourced mathematical functions. This data transform is a tool-making process, producing digital curves which are manipulated into forms, compiled into a prescient library of catalogued functions.

I appreciate the intricate pattern and intense colour of glass art. I find comfort in the experience of seeing and making complex compositions in this pliable and transparent medium. A long-standing grasp of complex mathematical constructs has become the language by which I am now synthesizing and fulfilling these personal connections to glassmaking."
