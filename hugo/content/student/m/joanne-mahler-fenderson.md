biography: "This series of four portraits, completed in 2021, investigates portraiture in which the direct gaze (despite meeting the gaze of the beholder) is still absorbed within its own internality.  Largely based on photographs of family caught in the moment, these paintings evolved from a single point without preliminary drawing - like a child left to wander, they meander outwards – space filled by their own accord rather than being bound by predefined borders, the finished painting always a surprise.  

My theoretical and practical focus for the Masters of Visual Art, Coursework, grew to evolve from three influences - Fried, Freud and the Fayum portraits. Art theorist Michael Fried in Absorption and Theatricality analyses the immersive quality of art depicting absorption – that which appears to be made without the beholder in mind. Lucien Freud paints beginning at one point without being locked into pre-meditated borders or clear awareness of how the whole will unfold. The Fayum Portraits were painted to be beheld by family members of a deceased person for a short period of time before being buried. The gaze in these portraits is absorbed, intimate - and perhaps given their role as paintings not destined to be eternally beheld - remarkably present."
