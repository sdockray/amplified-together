biography: "The idea that productivity is morally correct has dominated and shaped my artistic practice and my life. This led to my investigations into digital spaces which are dominated by a neoliberal 'girlboss' rhetoric, where self-entrepreneurialism and hustle culture reign and even something as traditional, tactile, and personal as art or craft are merely a vehicle to sell a flawless self-image and lifestyle. In this environment womens physical beauty is scrutinized as closely as the work they produce, yet authenticity is upheld as both the key to success and a moral necessity. The emphasis on the body paradoxically contributes to the dissociative effect of doom scrolling through these glitzy small business posts as you wish your body was looking, producing, and feeling differently to how it is. I believe the augmented reality is a powerful way to convey the sensation of feeling both intimate and disembodied that these spaces generate."
