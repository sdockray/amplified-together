biography: "My practice this year has explored ways of representing a diasporic cultural identity that is un-fixed, embodied, and entangled. I see movement, practices, and relations as central to the experience of diaspora, rather than fixed images and traits. As such, I resist creating representations of identity solely based on national or geographic specificities. 
 
 My practice asks how mythologies, folklore, and ancient cultural practices may look in contemporary contexts, in a process of grounding and ungrounding objects and imagery which point to personal memories and fictions. I made paintings with accompanying sound work that juggle memories, rituals, and the aesthetics of cuteness and kitsch to show that cultural identity can exist in an infinite number of ways that are embodied and always interacting. I situate the 'self' in spaces that are in-flux; to create an identity that is self-conceptualised and unconforming to specific time and place."
