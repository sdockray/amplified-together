biography: "This installation explores the journeys undertaken by the Cameleers, who predominantly came from Pakistan, Northern India, Afghanistan & Iran, in the Australian Outback during the 1860s -1930s. My intention is to interact with the anxieties of history as it is in the process of redaction: to map it whilst in the process of erasure. Through a combination of natural dyes, fabric staining, printing, environmental materials, and hand drawn ink on textiles, I have reflected upon my research trip to Broken Hill and experiencing traces of the Cameleers that remains in the Australian landscape. As viewers are encouraged to explore the inside and outside of the tent, I ask you to ponder the accessibility and mobility of our collective history?"
