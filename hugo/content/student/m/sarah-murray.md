biography: "Sarah Murray's work conveys a bodily experience of landscape, engaging the body within the time space and place of the land and creating a symbiotic connection between them. Murray's pulsating and immersive works utilise the process of indexing, shifting grounds and perspectives and gesture and mark-making to create an embodied impression of space time and place and to create the bodily connection within the space and time of painting and drawing."
