biography: "My work is an exploration of the bodily relation to landscape, the physicality of making and the reflection of the internal psychological landscape. Working both en plein air and in the studio, I aim to create works that engages with the landscape and communicates our relationship with it. My work balances between figuration and abstraction and explores my interest in mark-making and the gestural nature of painting and drawing."
