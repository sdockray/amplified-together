biography: "Driven by insatiable curiosity, I investigate the function and behaviour of physical materials, mathematical constructs, and their relationships. I work to comprehend things by seeing, questioning, and making. I use these methods to manifest objects I wish to see exist.

My research investigates the complex nature of human color perception, presenting a modern expansion of vision, combining digital fabrication, analysis, and traditional glassmaking to produce ‘proof of concept’ art glass that describes color sensations with different dimension. 

My work utilises digital and physical techniques for data capture, data manipulation, and object fabrication to render the color information describing previously published glass art into physical forms.

This work presents posthuman artificial replicas of how we experience color, via postdigital means. By transforming color into shape, shifting the dimension of perception, an experience unlike any other is created, questioning the human condition and its relationship to the sensation of color."
