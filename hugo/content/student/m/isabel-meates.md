biography: "In 2021 as a Printmedia and Drawing student, I produced a series of drawings which shifted from the observational into abstraction. Deconstruction methodology was used to generate compositions which are 'oppositional'. The notion of 'structural unity' was abandoned for a drawing process which was indefinite though responsive. At current, my project investigates the movement of analogue drawing into digital. A composition on a computer page can be reconstructed in many variations. Transferring analogue information into a simple digital format allowed the drawings to develop outwards."
