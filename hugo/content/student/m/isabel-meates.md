biography: "As a Master of Art History & Curatorial Studies- Printmedia and Drawing student at the ANU SOAD, I produced a series of drawings which shifted from observational to abstract. Deconstruction methodology was used to generate compositions which were ‘oppositional’. The notion of ‘structural unity’ was abandoned for a drawing process which was indefinite though responsive. Currently my project investigates the movement of analogue drawing into digital. A composition on a computer page can be quickly reconstructed in many variations. Transferring analogue information into a simple digital format allows the drawings to develop outwards."
