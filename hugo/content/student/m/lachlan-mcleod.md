biography: "Lachlan McLeod, glass artist: My work provides insight, understanding and the capacity for reflection on the educational, emotional, and physical challenges that I have endured.
Glass whilst appearing transparent can be to the beholder so much more. My work provides insight into how art has impacted my life and given me the opportunity to show more of what and who I am.
The work consists of 7 words encased in a glass spray can atop 7 open faced plinths.  The words chosen may appear mundane but hold significance to me as they represent the impact Art has on my life.
Art has given me COURAGE, to believe in myself and what I can achieve. 
A COMMUNITY, that I can rely on. 
The ability to COMMUNICATE, when I thought I had no voice or was not sure what to say.
The OPPORTUNITY, to partake in adventures and experiences that I would never have tried.
A clarity of my own FAITH as well as a greater belief in myself and what I can achieve.
Demonstrated the impact of INTEGRITY as Art is your own truth. 
Finally, Art has given me FREEDOM, to express myself and my independence without the fear of judgement as it is my work."
