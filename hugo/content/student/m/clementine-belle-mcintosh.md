biography: "“Local Gifts” uses the act of blanketing to make visible interweaving relationships in local suburban environments. The gift economy is used as a site of artmaking, to familiarise myself as a newcomer to the suburbia of Ngunnawal and Ngambri country, ACT. Fibre-based blankets made from gifted, recycled and collected waste, records site-specific narratives between myself and others (strangers and nonhuman). I made-with local nonhuman elements through the erosive acts of stomping, burying, hanging, and soaking. Audiences are invited to interact with the installation’s tactility - considering the local narratives suggested in collected roadside discards and assembled blanket parts. Once the graduate exhibition is over my blankets will be re-gifted and composted, returning to the nonlinear systems of the gift economy and environment."
