biography: "Animation grants us the power to bring any fantasy to life in motion. Pre-digital “2D” animation, in all its handmade forms, might bring us closest to this act of creation. This work - like all animated work - is a negotiation between aestheticism, nostalgia, and the enormous expense of labour required to make an image move. Weaponising technological nostalgia to sooth the uneasy residence of the animated image in gallery space, the installation describes a longing for the obsolete."
