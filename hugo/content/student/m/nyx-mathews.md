biography: "Nyx Mathews (born on Wurrundjeri Land, Melbourne; lives and works on Ngunnawal Country, Canberra).
 Mathews is an early-career artist working across sculpture, photography and new media. Their delicate, materially ambiguous, speculative sculptures explore the materiality and forms of the 21st century built environment and its impact on human beings. Their current body of work investigates the monumental art museum, a space whose systems and structures are simultaneously beautiful and deeply flawed. 
 
 Mathews has exhibited work in Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney, including two solo exhibitions and multiple two- and three-person exhibitions. Mathews’ work has been curated into various group exhibitions locally and interstate. They have received various awards and scholarships, including the Peter & Lena Karmel Honours Scholarship in the School of Art (2020), Corning Museum of Glass Scholarship, NY (2018) and multiple EASS awards for their third year body of work. Mathews has twice received an ANU Chancellor’s Commendation of Outstanding Academic Performance.
 Their work is held in private collections in Australia and overseas."
