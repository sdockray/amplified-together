biography: "My curiosity in the photos and heirlooms that were tethered to the people who came before us, and how through these items, they are connected to us still in the present. Has been the bases of my body of work, over the course of this year, for my 3rd year studies. 

By assembling, collecting and reflecting on the personal effects that belonged to my Nonni and Bisnonni (Grandparents and Great Grandparents); their narrative of searching for belonging was uncovered. Through the medium of glass, I set out in creating a series of four layered panels, to become a new space for these hidden and tucked away reminders of the displacement, migration, isolation and gentrification they went through after WWII. These images evoke an ephemeral sense in my display, by highlighting their existence, transforming the size of these small personal artifacts into larger replications, are an effort to mirror the faith they clung on too. The stress that the process of imprinting and layering onto the glass I have undertaken, means the longevity of the work is subject to crack and break. These imperfections, ticking time bombs, that could fracture or erase the images are one in the same with the people and places within the work. My hope is for viewers too look within their own reasons to saviour and collect similar materials, to see them now in a new light."
