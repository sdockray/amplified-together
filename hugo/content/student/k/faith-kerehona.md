biography: "WHEN BLOOD TIES AND UNTIES YOU' is a Street Art installation located in the Saigon Grocer Laneway in Dickson. These personal works frame an experience of Maori identity, diffusion and diaspora in Australia. It celebrates the collective consciousness of shared belonging, acceptance, and love, equally coined with the struggles and search for identity, place, and a spiritual home.
 
 Graduating from degrees in Sociology and Visual Art, I utilised sociological interviewing to investigate my familyâ€™s varied experience of identity. The final works feature audio from these interviews that can be viewed through AR, combining analogue and digital techniques."
