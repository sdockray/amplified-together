please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "Historically, indoor plants have been a way to bring nature into the house in small doses. Looking after a ‘garden’ all year where normally one would be limited by weather and season brings a positive sense of accomplishment and responsibility. 

Green Thumb was made to figure out exactly how to illustrate a scene that will evoke the most amount of serenity within the viewer based on greenery, and how to work the composition into a fitting frame. 

Inspiration comes from botanical collage artist Travis Bedel, as well as an artist from the Botanical Art Society of Australia, Annie Hughes. I also drew inspiration from historical still life paintings such as those by John Ruskin and used contemporary composition and colouring to create a new, almost psychedelic kaleidoscope of my favourite plants. 

The project is made of acrylic paints on circular cardboard/wooden board canvases ranging from 15cm to 1m in diameter."
