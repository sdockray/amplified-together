biography: "Concept art is a way of representing ideas for films, video games, animations and many other products in their early developmental stages. These artworks are often in many different styles to the finished game. They are largely about conveying ideas and thinking about the tone of the game, rather than creating one coherent vision.
 
 This concept art piece for a video game that I am currently in the development stages of creating. The game The Bay centers around friends going to Batemans Bay in the height of Australian summer. It will let the player explore the area and talk to the characters that live there, creating a lively virtual world.
 
 Walking to the beach - shows the unique colour palette we get from our Australian bush that lines up so closely to so many of our beaches. Colour is a huge, dynamic part of video game creation and feeling; I am planning that interacting with the colour shift will be a direct feature of the game - hence the importance of exploring colour as much as possible during the concept art period."
