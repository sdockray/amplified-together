please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "These paintings are painted in 2020 and are acrylic and oil on canvas.

The series of works in my exhibit examine the abstract human form in relation to what we project to the world and what we keep private.

 The paintings are painted across multiple canvases to create large overall works; however, some can also be seen as separate pieces just like the complex nature of how society views us by categories and how we may also view ourselves.

The paintings are vibrant in colour and have a lot of movement they weave in and out of the canvas space. It was a mission of mine to not have the image be immediately and completely recognisable."
