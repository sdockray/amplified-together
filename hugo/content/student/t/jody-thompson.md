biography: "This body of work is inspired by natural phenomena such as the weather. The embodied, physical experiences of nature as perceived through my senses direct my responses to materials; such as the feeling of wind, the look of raindrops on glass, or diving under a wave. 
 
 To transcribe these experiences into glass, I reference other forms of movement in nature, such as swarm behaviour seen in flocks of birds and schools of fish, to inform my visualisation of movement in a flat object.
 
 The method I have developed in this work comes from the vernacular of drawing. My approach considers how I might use the straight, unbending line of a strand of glass to create or suggest movement. The material's ability to reflect and refract light also creates this illusion of movement; light moves along the work as the viewer shifts position.
 
 In turn, the drawings I have created were developed through translating this process onto paper."
