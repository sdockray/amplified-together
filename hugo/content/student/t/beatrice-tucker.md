biography: "The work 'Campus tours start here' explores how capitalist relations are reified and ingrained into space and social structures, restricting students agency in University life. The work makes clear the changing student experience of ANU undergrads over the last ten years, showing the growing impacts of the Neoliberal university model where students are primarily treated as consumers and commodities. In this model there is a divide between the reality of the ANU experience and the marketed value of this experience. This is why I've co-opted the marketing format of the campus tour, using and subverting its generic features to give voice to frank student perspectives that show up ANU marketing propaganda.
 
 The interviews for this work were conducted using an alternative oral history interview method that is collaborative, conversational, rejects the hierarchy between interviewer/interviewee; and thus embraces subjectivity, reflexivity and self-reflexivity. This work is political and calls for structural change, this is not a passive social critique that exists for its own sake. 
 
 There are two forms of the work. The first form is a tour to be completed with a mobile device on ANU campus, a form of digital, unremovable graffiti. The second form is a video tour that can be watched when installed in space, or online from anywhere."
