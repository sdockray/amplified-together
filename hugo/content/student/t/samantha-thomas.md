biography: "Samantha Thomas is an Australian photographer and designer whose art practice takes a conceptual and critical view on the world. In particular she comments on social issues, perceived normalities and stereotypes, and questions our function in the world. Working with photomedia, design and across various other mediums such as printmaking, Samantha explores the humour of the everyday and adopts this as a running theme throughout her work - utilising humour as a catalyst when addressing confronting ideals. Samantha is completing her Bachelor of Visual Arts majoring in Photomedia and Bachelor of Design in 2021 at the Australian National University (ANU) in the School of Art and Design. She has exhibited in Insight Out Exhibition with aMBUSH Gallery (2021), Amplified Together Graduating Exhibition (2020), Moneylab X: Economythologies (2020), 'Close and Far' at ANU (2019), ANU's Instagram Exhibition (2018), and has been recognised in the International (IPA), Monochrome and Chromatic Photography Awards."
