biography: "My work in this exhibition investigates the idea of an 'emotional landscape' and explores the terrain of human emotion, subconscious energy, and the body. The work is contextualised within the concepts of the psychology of flow and subconscious creation. 
  
 The work comprises of a mass of wheel-thrown ceramic vessels with a range of textures and finishes. The pieces are filled with movement, varying in size and scale, and are characterised by organic curves and exaggerated distortions. The objects individually represent a thought or feeling, which, as a part of an overall display, illustrate a whole landscape of human emotion and existence. 
 
 This reflects the power of expression and the freedom of having an outlet to communicate our inner thoughts and feelings. This is exemplified in my work through the wheel-throwing process which both physically and mentally connects the maker to their work, as well the way the works are stacked and displayed so connectedly. This body of work is an expression of self and an investigation into creating a physical embodiment of an internal experience."
