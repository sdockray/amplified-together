biography: "My works explore the physicality of comfort, and how fiction can play a part in that. As a child I was a constant day-dreamer, and creating narratives of comfort was something I did often. These narratives often featured creatures from my favourite stories or pets and animals in my life. My personal practice began many years ago in puppetry and incorporating that with my reflections on myself as an artist and maker have culminated in these works; Creature Comforts. The sculptural work I have created is a body of comfort, taking from life aspects that are comforting and often found desirable in animals, such as body warmth, the familiar weight of a body, cute facial features and soft fur. 
 
 I originally intended for the work to be interacted with physically in an exhibition, however circumstances have not allowed for this and so I invited people in my personal community to interact with the creatures I had created in a way that was comfortable for them, and asked if I could photograph them to capture the effect that these works have on a participant. From the wide range of participants these images give an impression of the narratives created between the participant and artwork that facilitate their experience."
