please_provide_your_artist_statement_max_150_words: "My work explores the construction of narrative through the usually-overlooked elements of suburbia. Seeking compositions from the hidden and designed-to-be-ignored elements of the urban landscape, I find stories of warning, safety, comfort and risk. Yet, intertwined in this complicated matrix of signs is an inherent ambiguity â€“ about those who came before, and their purpose.

Since 2018, I have painted directly from life, exclusively. This approach makes each work not just the visual likeness of a physical space, but a kind of diary or record of the time I spent there. This gives my work a freshness and a clarity, and allows the paint to speak for itself; to be front and centre as a medium, and not just implicit in some kind of photographic illusion. As we try to make sense of our moment in history and its unrelenting barrage of conflicting messages, such clarity is rare and important."
