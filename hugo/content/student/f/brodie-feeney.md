biography: "Brodie Feeney is an impassioned designer whose practice critically navigates contexts through speculative analysis. Often whimsical and high spirited, his works are treated as an opportunity to explore, investigate and be inspired by the natural world and it's many curiously beautiful oddities. Moreover, he continuously seeks to engage and understand foreign processes and mediums, both physical and digital.
 
 Brodie is completing his bachelor of Design in 2021 at the Australian National University. He was awarded a scholarship by the Kesic Foundation to attend a summer program at Parsons School of Design, New York, in 2017. His works will be exhibited at the Swedish Embassy's Beyond Borders: People, Plastic, Pollution Exhibition in 2022."
