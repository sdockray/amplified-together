biography: "Photography is often seen as preserving and representing reality. The term 'truth claim' describes this virtue. My work explores and disputes this belief, showing the photographer as the ultimate manipulator of reality. 
 
 To create my work, I make detailed plans and sketches and construct scenes using cardboard. When photographing the scenes, I determine the perspectiveâ€”what is included and (more importantly) what is excludedâ€”using a film camera and careful lighting to disrupt the details.
 
 This series, Childhood Home, takes my memories of this home, recreates them as cardboard scenes and transports them into imagery. I present these memories as the truth. Memories, like photography, are subjective and accurate only to the individual. These images exclude all context and surroundings, obscuring the truth of the moment. 
  
 The scenes I stage are intentionally minimal. They lack specificity, creating an idea of a space made from light and shadow. The viewer can insert their memories, feeding into a sense of nostalgia and longing for a place indeterminate. 
 
 My photographs are my interpretations of these spaces, these places now existing only as they were in my memories, and the truth a mere representation."
