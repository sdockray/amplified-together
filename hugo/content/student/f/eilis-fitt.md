biography: "Where do we draw the line between rubbish and resource? 

What goods can come when you rummage through a bin?  
And what bads might be uncovered? 

What does it mean to capitalise on the wastefulness of capitalism? 

Using a compost-based methodology, Dumpster Dining explores how food waste and wasted food can be tools for building community and critical practice. Over the course of this project, I have staged a series of Bin Banquets: site-specific community picnics featuring food found in suburban supermarket dumpsters. These events invite my community to ponder the ethics and realities of dumpster diving as a form of critical and creative practice.  

During my process, I have journeyed to the bins again and again; dumpster diving has become a playful indulgence, a tedious chore, a grubby escapade and a late-night ritual. This project is guided by principles of digging in the dirt, tending to the offcuts and gleaning, turning and re-turning scraps (of food, conversations, fabric), to create a generative, inclusive and sustaining space.  

My patchwork rug is a functional, responsive and expanding object; its threads hold the history of our picnics and provide a space for us to gather in future. Bin Night Specials is a zine that documents moments from the first three picnics and serves as a manual and manifesto for future Bin Banquets.  

You are invited to take a zine and add your own bin-bounty-inspired recipe, incorporating as much of the found produce as you like."
