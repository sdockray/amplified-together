biography: "Xingweiai Fang is a master degree student studying design and visual art in the Australian National University. For almost two decades, Xingweiai has been formulating his artistic language resourcing from academic cultivation, the understanding of daily life and his experience living in different countries. During the time in China, Europe and Australia, he received basic knowledge of visual art in terms of theoretical and technical studies. His research ranges from conventional sketching, mixed media painting resourcing from recyclable materials, creative code, and collaborative art. Fang pays attention to human behavior, collective psychology, aesthetics studies and art philosophy and adapts these subjects in his visual language. In doing this, he believes that art is able to resonate with audience without any obstacles. Fang, so far aging 25, claims that his artworks should be able to communicate with audience."
