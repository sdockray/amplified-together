biography: "Frances is an artist working in glass, ceramics and print. Her work explores the relationship between vision and perception and how we see the world around us. She is strongly influenced by her background as a scientist where the act of observation is critical and this has carried through to her art. Her current work has arisen from life altering changes to her sight. As a scientist she is intrigued by the physical aspects of how that change occurred. The challenge is how to express that feeling of change to a wider audience through her art. It is a personal story that is universal.
 
 Glass and ceramics provide an intriguing way to engage viewers so that they may experience a sense of what it is like to have their sight altered permanently. She is currently doing an Honours degree at the Australian National University School of Art and Design."
