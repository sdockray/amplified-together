biography: "This video guides you through the alleys of an imaginary town sculpted and painted within a VR. Developed as part of my honours project exploring the potential of VR as a painterly medium. The environment aims to achieve a European noir ambience, taking inspiration from psychological horror films and also references 1920's - 1940's cultural aesthetics. Covid lockdowns have also influenced the way in which the work was made and presented, and some elements of the video are specifically constructed to reflect this experience."
