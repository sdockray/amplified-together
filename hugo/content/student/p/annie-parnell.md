biography: "If weeds only exist in relation to human use, what does it mean to be a weed?
 
 On Ngunnawal, Ngunawal and Ngambri Country- Plants are implicated into colonial spatial design, so what is the significance of that which resists weeds ?
 
 Developed over the course of my honours year, in three Acts this body of work utilises a variety of material and post-studio practices to explore the complexities of colonisation through plants.
 
 Acts of Care - offers healing encounters through an installation of medicinal plant balms, seed bombs, and invitations to soothe.
 
 Acts of Destruction - explores what new perspectives of space arise from the destruction of a site-specific porcelain thistle installation at ANZAC Parade.
 
 Acts of Noticing - uses participatory art strategies to bring participants to notice overlooked weedy inhabitants
 
 Through these works complicated relationships between plants and colonisation begin to be unravelled, arising questions about our relationships to nature in the anthropocene"
