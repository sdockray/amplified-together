biography: "My work aims to draw attention to the negative social and environmental effects of overconsumption and irresponsible waste management of clothes. These include pollution, the exploitation of workers, and an abundance of wasted clothing that ends up contaminating cities and the environment. This work depicts a dumping site for discarded clothes. Many sites like this exist in countries where imported clothing donations are unable to be sold, sometimes being added to landfills, or piling up at the edges of cities. By transforming textiles into paper pulp, I aim to highlight the embedded histories within the material. By using old bed sheets, clothes, and fabric scraps from family and friends I draw a connection between the personal and the global."
