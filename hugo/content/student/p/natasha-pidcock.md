biography: "As a result of accelerated capitalism and technology, the virtual and physical space we inhabit is characterised by the endless circulation of imagery. My artwork explores how image proliferation in analogue and digital media networks can be represented in painting. The formal elements I employ in my work are influenced by photo-digital techniques of collage, digital image circulation, and the repetition and degradation of printmaking. The decision to use these processes is informed by my research into the history of art and contemporary image culture. I am particularly interested in what ways the painting process can decelerate the speed in which images are consumed. My research asks whether painting can make us more aware of the effect of networks, and the temporality of images in our disposable culture of contemporary capitalism."
