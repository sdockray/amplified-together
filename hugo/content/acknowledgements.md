**__ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS__** 

The Australian National University acknowledges, celebrates and pays our respects to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people of the Canberra region and to all First Nations Australians on whose traditional lands we meet and work, and whose cultures are among the oldest continuing cultures in human history.

TThe Graduating Exhibition at the ANU School of Art and Design acknowledges the strength and commitment of the 2022 cohort of students, who have completed their studies and creative outcomes in often challenging times.

The richness and diversity of practice seen throughout this exhibition is evident with strong partnering of teaching and learning between academics and students, and extends to include technicians, sessional staff, professional staff and a broader exchange of ideas within the University.

Thank you to our outstanding academics and technical officers for their unwavering support, knowledge, skills, stimulation and enthusiasm.

The design for this year's Grad Show Website is by Anthony Waymouth, a student from our course [DESN2006, Front End Web: Crafting Online Experiences](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/desn2006). Thank you to Dr Pia Van Gelder and Dr Sean Dockray for their expertise in developing and building the website. Thank you to Gallery team Megan Hinton, Irina Agaronyan and Adina West for coordinating the exhibition and to Dr Waratah Lahy for managing the Emerging Artist Support Scheme.
