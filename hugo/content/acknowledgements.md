**_ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS_** 

The Graduating Exhibition at the ANU School of Art and Design acknowledges the strength and commitment of the 2021 cohort of students, who have accomplished a challenging conclusion to the year.  

The richness and diversity of practice seen throughout this exhibition is evident with strong partnering of teaching and learning between academics and students, and extends to include technicians, sessional staff, professional staff and a broader exchange of ideas within the University.  

Thank you to our outstanding academics and technical officers for their unwavering support, knowledge, skills, stimulation and enthusiasm. 

Thank you to Dr Pia Van Gelder and Dr Sean Dockray for their expertise in developing and building the website. Thank you to Gallery team Megan Hinton, Irina Agaronyan and Dionisia Salas for coordinating the exhibition and to Dr Waratah Lahy for managing the Emerging Artist Support Scheme.
